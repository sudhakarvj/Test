<p class="chapau">Luis M. Chiappe</p>
<p class="noindent">Birds in flight look very different from the stereotypical dinosaurs of the Mesozoic era, the geologic time contained between 251 and 66 million years ago. Yet, fossil discoveries from around the world have revealed a cohort of intermediate forms blurring this apparent divide, and studies on this paleontological bonanza have demonstrated that birds and the extinct dinosaurs that lived many millions of years ago actually share many features in common.</p>
<p class="indent">Birds have a very deep evolutionary past, one that was recognized long ago with the discovery of the first specimen of <em>Archaeopteryx lithographica</em> in the nineteenth century (Wellnhofer 2009) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig1">fig. 2.1</a>). This oldest and most primitive bird lived in what is today southern Germany at the end of the Jurassic period, some 150 million years ago. Many other groups of younger and more advanced birds evolved, thrived, and became extinct during the subsequent Cretaceous period, their remains unearthed worldwide and from rocks dating approximately between 131 and 66 million years ago (Chiappe 2007, O&#8217;Connor et al. 2011, Zhou 2014). Modern birds, those belonging to lineages represented by more than 10,000 species alive today, also trace their origin to the Mesozoic era; their earliest recognized fossils date back some 80 to 75 million years ago (Mayr 2014).</p>
<p class="indent">The reptilian appearance of the skeleton of <em>Archaeopteryx</em>, together with a host of studies ranging from embryological to molecular, have consolidated the notion that birds evolved from within animals traditionally classified as reptiles (Gauthier et al. 1988, Hedges 1994, Gill 2007). In evolutionary terms, birds are a highly specialized group of feathered reptiles, just as bats are a highly specialized group of winged mammals. While the long evolutionary history of birds and their reptilian ancestry has been long recognized and universally accepted by the scientific community, details of the group&#8217;s evolutionary origin&#8212;the specific relationship of birds to other groups of reptiles&#8212;remained contentious for most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Feduccia 1999, Chiappe 2007, Pickrell 2014).</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, the earliest ideas about the evolutionary descent of birds date back to the 1860s (Padian and Chiappe 1998). Since then, many different groups of reptiles&#8212;from duck-billed dinosaurs to the extinct flying reptiles of the Mesozoic era (pterosaurs) and from crocodiles to other groups of reptiles that originated more than 200 million years ago in the Triassic period&#8212;have been identified as the closest relatives of <em>Archaeopteryx</em> and living birds (Chiappe 2007, 2009). Theropod dinosaurs, the group that includes famous dinosaurs such as <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> and <em>Velociraptor</em>, have been among the earliest proposed candidates for the ancestry of birds, a hypothesis that has gone through periods of contention and widespread popularity since its inception (Chiappe 2007, Wellnhofer 2009). Today, however, the hypothesis that birds evolved from these dinosaurs receives almost universal support, largely because of the enormous body of evidence from disparate fields of science accumulated over the last five decades (Padian and Chiappe 1998, Chiappe 2007, Xu et al. 2014, Brussatte et al. 2015). These studies have cemented the notion that birds originated, presumably in the Jurassic (some 190 to 160 million years ago), from animals traditionally classified as theropod dinosaurs. Within these dinosaur groups, birds are overwhelmingly interpreted as belonging to the maniraptorans and, particularly, to the more birdlike paravians (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig2">fig. 2.2</a>), a group that includes a variety of small and feathered species, some even capable of flight (Xu et al. 2003, Han et al. 2014). Since birds are evolutionarily nested within theropod dinosaurs, they are regarded as living dinosaurs, namely &#8220;avian dinosaurs&#8221;; for clarity, paleontologists and evolutionary biologists refer to those dinosaurs that are not birds as &#8220;non-avian&#8221; dinosaurs.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_10"></a>This chapter summarizes the diverse lines of evidence that converge in support of the hypothesis that birds are living theropod dinosaurs and how feathers and flapping flight&#8212;two of the most distinct attributes of birds&#8212;might have evolved during the long evolutionary history of the group. It also reviews the many different groups of extinct birds that thrived during the Mesozoic era, fossils of which bridge the gap between the extinct non-avian dinosaurs and their present-day relatives, recounting the saga of how living birds became the remarkable animals they are.</p>

<h3 class="h3">THE DINOSAURIAN ANCESTRY OF BIRDS</h3>
<p class="noindent">The notion that the ancestry of birds can be traced back to the theropod dinosaurs that lived during the Mesozoic era is not new. Several researchers argued in favor of this relationship soon after the publication of Charles Darwin&#8217;s <em>Origin of Species</em>, but it was Thomas Henry Huxley who, nearly 150 years ago, provided the most compelling evidence for the dinosaurian ancestry of birds. As early as 1868, Huxley had amassed a list of more than 30 features of the hindlimbs and pelvis that were shared between non-avian theropods such as the Jurassic <em>Megalosaurus</em> and <em>Compsognathus</em>, and present-day birds (Huxley 1868). In spite of this evidence, and the discovery of birdlike dinosaurs with even greater similarity to modern birds in subsequent years&#8212;most remarkably the skeletons of small-bodied theropods such as the now-familiar <em>Velociraptor</em> and <em>Oviraptor</em> (Osborn 1924)&#8212;the hypothesis of a dinosaurian origin of birds fell into disgrace for much of the twentieth century.</p>
<p class="indent">The main reason for such a change in popularity is likely rooted in the evolutionary framework of the time. Just as Huxley was amassing morphological evidence in support of a dinosaurian origin of birds, other researchers were claiming that the similarities between birds and non-avian theropods were instead the result of evolutionary convergence (i.e., similar traits that evolved independently among these organisms and in response to the similar functional requirements of bipedalism). These claims were strengthened by what was viewed as a major weakness of the theropod hypothesis of bird origins: the fact that none of the fossils of non-avian theropods known at the turn of the nineteenth century had clavicles. Such an absence was viewed as a critical flaw of this hypothesis because it resonated with an evolutionary principle popular at that time&#8212;Dollo&#8217;s law of irreversibility&#8212;which stated that structures lost during the course of evolution could not re-evolve. Therefore, if the dinosaurs assumed to be the ancestors of birds had lost their clavicles, birds (whose clavicles form the notorious wishbone) could not be the descendants of those animals. In other words, dinosaurs had evolved into a dead end; they were too specialized to be avian ancestors. The 1913 discovery of the Middle Triassic <em>Euparkeria</em> in the Karoo Desert of South Africa (Broom 1913), a small and morphologically generalized archosauromorph reptile (and a distant relative of dinosaurs), provided a candidate for the ancestry of birds that suited the evolutionary thinking of the time. Not surprisingly, <em>Euparkeria</em> was quickly adopted as the evolutionary paradigm for the origin of birds, and this view was widely popularized by an influential early twentieth-century book, <em>The Origin of Birds</em> (Heilmann 1926), by Danish artist and amateur paleontologist Gerhard Heilmann.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_11"></a>It took decades for the arguments about the evolutionary convergence between non-avian theropods and birds, and the ideas that the latter had evolved from a Triassic stock of primitive archosauromorphs, to be reconsidered. This task fell primarily on the shoulders of a dinosaur paleontologist from Yale University, John Ostrom, who, in the 1960s and 1970s, conducted detailed comparative studies between <em>Archaeopteryx</em> and a series of paravian theropods such as the dromaeosaurid <em>Deinonychus antirrhopus</em> (Ostrom 1969, 1975, 1976). These studies led to the resurgence in support of the dinosaurian origin of birds that has grown ever since with more and more discoveries. Today, this hypothesis argues that birds evolved from within a group of generally small-bodied theropods known as maniraptorans and that their closest relatives include paravian dinosaurs such as the sickle-clawed dromaeosaurids (<em>Deinonychus</em>, <em>Velociraptor mongoliensis</em>, and their kin; Turner et al. 2007) and the lightly built <em>Troodon formosus</em>, <em>Mei long</em>, and relatives (Makovicky and Norell 2004); most current studies argue that birds are the sister-group of a clade (Deinonychosauria) composed of Dromaeosauridae and Troodontidae (e.g., Turner et al. 2007, Xu et al. 2014). Nonetheless, the various similarities between living birds and their theropod predecessors can be recognized in many other dinosaur groups, including those that lived in the Triassic and that represent some of the earliest branches of the theropod tree (e.g., <em>Tawa hallae</em>; Nesbitt et al. 2009, Brussatte et al. 2015) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig3">fig. 2.3</a>). From an osteological perspective, these similarities include a suite of very general features (bipedal posture with vertically oriented hindlimbs, three fully developed toes facing forward, S-shaped neck, among others) and many more specific attributes including vertebral pneumatization by air sacs (presumably developing a connection with the lungs similar to that of modern birds), unique structures in the vertebral column and rib cage, elongated forelimbs with wrist bones allowing swivel-like movements of the hand, and similar structures in the pelvis and hindlimbs, as well as numerous other characteristics distributed throughout the entire skeleton (Gauthier 1986, Brusatte 2013). Indeed, many skeletal features previously thought to be exclusively avian&#8212;such as wishbones, laterally facing wingpits, and large breastbones&#8212;are today known among different lineages of non-avian maniraptoran dinosaurs.</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2.4.</em> Cladogram showing the diminutive sizes that characterize the most basal lineages of paravians. New discoveries and recent phylogenetic studies document that many lineages of non-avian maniraptoran theropods underwent a prolonged process of miniaturization that was particularly marked among paravians. <em>Modified from Turner et al. 2007</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Although museums around the world emphasize the colossal dimensions reached by the extinct dinosaurs of the Mesozoic, such a superlative approach to the evolutionary history of these animals overlooks the fact that many non-avian dinosaurs had body sizes that fall within the range of living birds (Xu et al. 2003, Turner et al. 2007, Butler et al. 2010). In fact, a number of theropod groups&#8212;tyrannosaurs (Rauhut 2003), oviraptorosaurs (Xu et al. 2002), and others&#8212;had rather small early relatives. Particularly small are many early members of the two best-known groups of non-avian maniraptorans, dromaeosaurids (Norell et al. 2004) and troodontids (Makovicky et al. 2004), which document the extreme size reduction experienced at the base of the paravian clade of maniraptorans (the clade that includes troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and birds) (Turner et al. 2007) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig4">fig. 2.4</a>). Recent studies (Lee et al. 2014a) have shown how such a trend towards miniaturization started at least 50 million years prior to the divergence of <em>Archaeopteryx</em> and paedomorphosis (an heterochronic process in which the adults of the derived species retain traits of the juveniles of the ancestral species) has been claimed to be the underlying developmental mechanism for such a notable trend in size reduction (Bhullar et al. 2012).</p>
<p class="indent">In the last few decades, numerous discoveries from around the world and novel studies of fossil material have revealed a wealth of similarities between non-avian theropods and living birds that goes beyond the skeletal evidence and small body size. Fossilized eggs of theropod dinosaurs&#8212;some containing the remains of rare embryos&#8212;have shown that the shape of the eggs of non-avian maniraptorans and the microstructure of their shell were in many respects alike to those of present-day birds. Some of these dinosaurs (e.g., oviraptorids, troodontids) laid eggs of various degrees of asymmetry, with one pole narrower than the other and approaching the lopsided shape of a typical avian egg (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig5">fig. 2.5</a>). While egg shape varies significantly among amniotes, departure from symmetry around the equatorial axis is predominantly limited to non-avian theropods and birds (Deeming and Ruta 2014). In addition, calculations between the volume of the egg and the body mass of the egg-layer indicate that these dinosaurs also laid relatively larger egg volumes, which are typical of birds. Furthermore, the eggshell of these dinosaurs&#8212;calcified, as in all birds&#8212;was characterized by having more than one structural layer (denoted by a differential disposition of the calcite crystals) and by being pierced by fewer pores, both conditions common to avian eggs. Recent geochemical studies have even detected traces of coloration in eggs assigned to a Chinese Late Cretaceous oviraptorid, thus documenting the occurrence of colored eggs&#8212;otherwise known from birds, among amniotes&#8212;in non-avian maniraptorans (Wiemann et al. 2015).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_12"></a><a id="page_13"></a>Rarely, the fossil record has provided us with a glimpse of the behaviors of the extinct maniraptorans. An oviraptorid specimen containing a pair of shelled eggs inside its pelvic canal has provided support for interpretations arguing that these dinosaurs laid their eggs in a sequential pattern as opposed to en masse. Such interpretations have been long supported on the basis of the spatial arrangement of eggs within clutches of non-avian maniraptorans, which show that the eggs were arranged in pairs, as opposed to typical reptilian clutches (turtles, crocodiles, and other dinosaurs) in which they lack a particular spatial arrangement. Collectively, all this evidence indicates that non-avian maniraptorans laid their eggs at discrete intervals, perhaps taking up to several days to lay an entire clutch. Skeletons of troodontids and oviraptorids have been found in close association with, and often literally on top of, their egg clutches (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig6">fig. 2.6</a>). In troodontids, an adult skeleton was found directly on top of the vertically arranged eggs (Varricchio et al. 1997). In oviraptorids, several adult skeletons show the hindlimbs tucked against the belly of the animal and placed within an open space at the center of a clutch formed by dozens of pair-arranged eggs; the long forelimbs of the animal are often preserved embracing the periphery of the egg clutch. Such evidence indicates that several species within these dinosaur groups had nesting behaviors resembling those of brooding birds. These fossils suggest that, regardless of the specific purpose (shelter, incubation, or other), avian brooding behaviors had already evolved among non-avian maniraptorans (Norell et al. 1995, Clark et al. 1999).</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_14"></a>Further evidence documents additional behavioral similarities with birds. The skeletons of a few small troodontids from the Early Cretaceous of China (e.g., <em>M. long</em>, <em>Sinornithoides youngi</em>) are preserved with the hindlimbs flexed beneath the belly, the neck folded backward, and the skull tucked beneath a forelimb and against the ribcage (Xu and Norell 2004, Gao et al. 2012a). The arrangement of the skeletons together with characteristics of the sediments entombing them suggests that these dinosaurs died while sleeping. Such a skeletal arrangement hints at resting poses that are highly reminiscent of the stereotypical sleeping postures of many present-day birds. Additionally, a range of fossil traces from Cretaceous sites in Colorado has shed light on other aspects of the behavioral repertoire of non-avian theropods. These exceptional sites show series of bilobate depressions with a middle ridge, and in some instances with a tridactyl theropod footprint inside, that are difficult to associate with any behavior other than non-nesting courtships displays (Lockley et al. 2016). Such traces suggest that some non-avian dinosaur species had stereotypical courtship behaviors akin to those observed among some groups of living birds (e.g., scraping, arena display, lekking). Altogether, these snapshots of the behavior of non-avian theropods give us rare glimpses into the conducts of these extinct animals and extraordinary evidence in support of the dinosaurian ancestry of birds.</p>
<p class="indent">Further similarities are revealed by the microstructure of the bone tissues preserved in many fossil maniraptorans. While typical characteristics of bone histology (particularly the degree of vascularity and the rate of growth or deposition) are partially the result of the function performed by bone, studies have shown that they also carry a strong phylogenetic signal (Montes et al. 2010). In the last few decades, the study of these tissues has clearly demonstrated that although dinosaurs have been traditionally characterized as slow-growing behemoths, these animals had growth rates comparable to those of many living birds, even if they grew over multiple years (Chinsamy 2005). Furthermore, specialized bone tissues such as the medullary bone that female birds deposit inside the medullary cavity of their long bones during breeding season (a calcium reservoir recycled during eggshell production; see Dacke et al. 1993), have been documented among non-avian theropod dinosaurs such as <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> (Schweitzer et al. 2005). Once again, these discoveries highlight how non-avian dinosaurs shared key aspects of their reproductive physiology with modern birds.</p>
<p class="indent">Additional similarities between birds and the dinosaurs frequently identified as their closest relatives are now being hinted by provocative biochemical, immunological, and genomic investigations. Amino-acid sequences of putative proteins&#8212;particularly collagen, bone&#8217;s most abundant protein&#8212;found in soft tissues associated with bones of <em>T. rex</em> have highlighted an evolutionary closeness between this dinosaur and birds (Schweitzer et al. 2005, Asara et al. 2007). More recently, a study of eight bone samples from different types of dinosaurs (Bertazzo et al. 2015) observed structures similar to the calcified collagen fibers found in modern bone and other structures resembling the red blood cells of birds. The elemental analysis of the latter structures resulted in a composition that was remarkably similar to that of emu blood. While these studies remain controversial (see Dalton 2008, Service 2015), mounting evidence is suggesting that complex biomolecules can survive under unusual conditions for millions of years (Schweitzer 2011, Bertazzo et al. 2015). If correctly interpreted, the studies of the putative collagen of <em>T. rex</em> and other non-avian dinosaurs provide additional evidence in support of the dinosaurian origin of birds. Equally tantalizing are other studies that, by correlating the sizes of bone cells with those of genomes (the entire genetic material of an organism), have revealed that non-avian theropods had the small genomic dimensions characteristic of modern birds (Organ et al. 2007, 2008). These studies used a well-established correlation between the dimensions of bone cells and the sizes of the genomes of modern organisms and made estimates of genome sizes in extinct animals based on the sizes of the osteocytes lacunae (the spaces originally occupied by bone cells) visible in thin sections of fossilized bones. Most of the non-avian theropod bones examined pointed at genome sizes significantly smaller than those estimated for other Mesozoic dinosaurs; the genome sizes of these non-avian theropods fell within the range of living birds, which have genomes that are about half the size of those of crocodiles and mammals (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig7">fig. 2.7</a>). Recent studies (Zhang et al. 2014) have identified several genetic processes (deletion of repetitive DNA portions, entire gene loss, and others) as the causal factor for the characteristic small size of the genome of modern birds. It is likely that these same processes contributed to the reduction of the genome sizes in non-avian theropods. These processes may have been acting on the genomes of other volant groups of vertebrates, as Organ and Shedlock (2009) also found relatively small genome sizes in pterosaurs and bats, thus providing fresh evidence pointing at a correlation between a decrease in genome size and the evolution of flight in vertebrates.</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2.7.</em> Inferences about the sizes of the genomes of non-avian theropods (in picograms, 10<sup>&#8211;12</sup>g) indicate that these dinosaurs evolved the small genome sizes of birds more than 230 million years ago.

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2.8.</em> The broad phylogenetic distribution of different lineages of non-avian theropods carrying either protofeathers or vaned feathers of modern appearance suggests that the bodies of most theropod dinosaurs were covered by plumage. <em>Modified from Chiappe 2007</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_15"></a>In spite of the many different lines of evidence in support of the theropod origin of birds, nothing has consolidated the universal acceptance of this hypothesis as much as the discovery of a cohort of non-avian dinosaurs with feathers. After two decades of paleontological discoveries from around the world, fossils of more than 20 species of non-avian theropod dinosaurs provide direct evidence of integumentary coverings interpreted as feathers, and a number of other fossils reveal circumstantial evidence (e.g., quill knobs) for the presence of these structures in additional species. Known primarily from the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous of northeastern China (Norell and Xu 2005, Long and Schouten 2008, Xu et al. 2014, 2015) but also from Late Jurassic and Late Cretaceous sites in Europe (Rauhut et al. 2012) and North America (Zelenitsky et al. 2012, Van Der Reest et al. 2016), respectively, these species are phylogenetically distributed over a large portion of the theropod tree (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig8">fig. 2.8</a>). The characteristics of the plumage also differ greatly among these species. In some, the plumage was made exclusively of simple or loosely branched filaments, which are referred to as protofeathers. These structures are known for examples of basal tetanurans (e.g., <em>Sciurumimus albersdoerferi</em>; Rauhut et al. 2012), early tyrannosaurus (from the two-meter-long <em>Dilong paradoxus</em> to the nine-meter-long <em>Yutyrannus huali</em>), and a variety of compsognathids (e.g., <em>Sinosauropteryx prima</em>, <em>Sinocalliopteryx gigas</em>; Ji et al. 2007). These protofeathers range significantly in size (e.g., 2 cm in <em>Dilong</em> but 20 cm in <em>Yutyrannus</em>) and their length also varies according to their position within the body. Evidence of protofeathers has also been found among herbivorous and omnivorous theropod dinosaurs such as in the small-headed and typically toothless ornithomimosaurs and the therizinosaurs, the last of which had extended necks, small heads, long arms with powerful claws, and stout feet. Fossils of the therizinosaur <em>Beipiaosaurus inexpectus</em> (Xu et al. 1999) show that these animals also carried a small number of broader and longer (10 to 15 centimeters) single filaments projecting from the head, neck, and tail; these structures have been interpreted as specialized protofeathers that may have played a role in the sexual displays of these dinosaurs (Xu et al. 2009).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_16"></a>In species closer to the origin of birds, the plumage consisted of both protofeathers and additional structures with the characteristics typical of a modern feather. Abundant examples of the latter feathers are known among the oviraptorosaurs (Ji et al. 1998, Zhou and Wang 2000), a group of herbivorous/omnivorous dinosaurs that are more closely related to birds than any of the previously mentioned feathered dinosaurs. One of these dinosaurs, the turkey-sized <em>Caudipteryx zoui</em>, had forelimb and tail feathers with multiple thin filaments branching off either side of a central shaft in a parallel arrangement; these are essentially feathers of modern aspect in which barbs form two large and flattened vanes on either side of a rachis. At least 14 symmetrically vaned feathers, some reaching up to 20 cm in length, projected from the distal half of the forelimbs of <em>Caudipteryx</em>, and a series of equally vaned, long feathers formed a fan at the end of its relatively short tail. The distalmost feathers of the forelimb were attached to the middle digit of its three-digit hand, the same digit that supports the primaries of today&#8217;s birds. Fossils of this dinosaur also show that the longest feathers of the forelimb were sided by shorter feathers toward both the tip and the base of the wing, an arrangement typical of modern avian wings.</p>
<p class="indent">Many fossils of Chinese Early Cretaceous dromaeosaurids, particularly the pheasant-sized <em>Microraptor zhaoianus</em> (Xu et al. 2003, Turner et al. 2012), show how the plumage of the non-avian theropods closer to the origin of birds evolved a further degree of feather differentiation (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig9">fig. 2.9</a>). In addition to having two- to five-cm-long simple protofeathers, the elongated forelimbs of these paravian dinosaurs had long feathers with vanes of disproportionate widths; as in their modern counterparts, the leading vanes of these asymmetric feathers were narrower than the trailing vanes of the feathers. <em>Microraptor</em> also carried a fan of long, vaned feathers at the end of the tail, although these had symmetrical vanes. The distalmost pair of tail feathers stretched more than 22 cm in <em>Microraptor</em>, close to a third of the length of the entire animal; in its heavier close relative, <em>Changyuraptor yangi</em>, they reached more than 30 cm in length (Han et al. 2014). The forelimbs of these Chinese dinosaurs became transformed in long and slender wings of essentially modern design, which were formed by asymmetrically vaned feathers. As is typical of the wings of modern birds, the primaries of these theropods were longer but fewer in number than the secondaries. Similarly, the farthest primaries were aligned with the direction of the digits, while the remaining flight feathers were angled with respect to the skeletal forelimb. Additionally, and most surprisingly, these dromaeosaurids had a set of long, vaned feathers (some reaching 20 cm in length) projecting from the lower leg (i.e., shin and foot) (Xu et al. 2003).</p>
<figure class="imagef" id="ch2fig9"><img src="../images/Figure_2.9.jpg" alt="Images"/></figure>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2.9.</em> The Early Cretaceous non-avian maniraptoran <em>Microraptor zhaianus</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">A similarly differentiated plumage is also known in several troodontids. Well-known examples of these paravians include the Middle to Late Jurassic <em>Anchiornis huxleyi</em> (Hu et al. 2009) and the younger, Early Cretaceous, <em>Jinfengopteryx elegans</em> (Ji et al. 2005). Both carried abundant protofeathers but fossils of the former show a set of long, vaned feathers projecting from its hindlimbs (including feathers covering its toes), and the only known specimen of the latter displays a frond-like tail formed by long and symmetrically vaned feathers that become increasingly longer toward the tip.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite that, evidence of plumage is restricted to a fraction of the non-avian dinosaurs known to date. The fact that these fossils span over a large portion of the phylogeny of theropods and belong to species exhibiting a large diversity of sizes, appearances, and lifestyles suggests that feathers of different kinds covered the bodies of most theropod dinosaurs (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig8">fig. 2.8</a>). Just as modern-looking feathers evolved among the dinosaurian predecessors of birds, so did a variety of molecular, morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits that were traditionally assumed to have evolved at the onset of, or after, the rise of birds. Altogether, the discovery that these traits first evolved among non-avian theropods provides compelling evidence in support of the hypothesis that argues that birds are indeed living dinosaurs.</p>
<h3 class="h3">THE ORIGIN OF FEATHERS</h3>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_17"></a>Feathers are a universal and fundamental characteristic of birds. These lightweight and yet strong keratin structures have evolved over millions of years into many types, differentiated by variations in their organization, size, and the characteristics of their shafts, barbs, and barbules (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig10">fig. 2.10</a>). Discoveries of feathered non-avian dinosaurs have demonstrated that the origin of these quintessential avian structures pre-dated the rise of birds, yet the original function of these singular integumentary appendages remains controversial (Dececchi et al. 2016).</p>
<p class="indent">The first direct evidence of feathers in non-avian dinosaurs came with the discovery, in 1996, of a complete skeleton of the compsognathid theropod <em>Sinosauropteryx prima</em> from the Early Cretaceous of northeastern China (Chen et al. 1998, Ji et al. 1998). This 60-cm-long skeleton was surrounded by a halo of dark, filament-like structures, which varied in length substantially across the body. The fact that the bones of the skeleton were variably separated from the bases of these structures, a pattern that clearly reflected the thickness of the connective tissue along different regions of the body, indicated that these were external structures. Furthermore, the structures were hollowed and subdivided into thinner filaments that branched off from their bases, conditions seen among modern feathers (Currie and Chen 2001).</p>
<p class="indent">Since the discovery of the first fossil of <em>Sinosauropteryx</em>, numerous other feathered non-avian theropods have provided evidence of the evolution of different feather types among the predecessors of birds. The discovery of superficially similar structures in small ornithischian dinosaurs such as psittacosaurs (Mayr et al. 2002) and heterodontosaurs (Zheng et al. 2009) has advanced the possibility that protofeathers might have first evolved outside theropods and, perhaps, even prior to the origin of all dinosaurs. The fact that the earliest phylogenetic divergences among the known non-avian feathered theropods correspond to animals with bodies that were covered by filament-like protofeathers, structures with obvious minimal (if any) aerodynamic capacity, has also provided evidence that the original function of the feather was not for the purpose of flight. Nonetheless, the presence of vaned feathers, with possible aerodynamic functions, anchored to the extremities of the limbs and tails of non-avian maniraptorans (e.g., <em>Caudipteryx</em>, <em>Microraptor</em>, <em>Changyuraptor</em>, <em>Anchiornis</em>, among others) suggests that feathers may have quickly been co-opted into incipient airfoils capable of generating aerodynamic forces (Burgers and Chiappe 1999, Chiappe 2007, Heers et al. 2014). The firmness and cohesiveness shown by the vanes of the pennaceous feathers of dromaeosaurids and oviraptorosaurs indicates that a Velcro-like system of interlocking barbules had already evolved among these dinosaurs.</p>

<p class="indent">Classic interpretations about the origin of feathers were influenced by the now-contested hypothesis that these structures evolved from reptilian scales that gradually became long, frayed, and flexible (Prum and Brush 2002). Advances in our understanding of feather development, however, have documented fundamental differences between scales and feathers. These studies, combined with the evidence revealed by the spectacular discoveries of feathered non-avian dinosaurs, led to the formulation of a now broadly accepted model for the origin and subsequent evolution of feathers (Prum 1999, Prum and Brush 2002). This model argues that modern feathers evolved as the result of a series of evolutionary transitions at the feather follicle that produced the variety of feathers observed today and in the fossil record (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig11">fig. 2.11</a>). The earliest stage of this evolutionary transition, Stage I, consists of an undifferentiated tubular collar (the follicle&#8217;s innermost epidermal layer) generating a simple, hollow cylinder. During Stage II, the collar differentiates barb ridges, which result in a feather with a tuft of unbranched barbs and a calamus. Further differentiation of the follicle&#8217;s collar could have led to two alternative stages: Stage IIIa, which leads to the development of the vaned feather with simple barbs fused to a central rachis, and Stage IIIb, which yields a feather with numerous branched barbs (i.e., with barbules) attached to a basal calamus. Regardless of the specific evolutionary path taken (either Stage IIIa or IIIb), the Stage IIIa+b is envisioned as resulting in a feather that is vaned and that has barbs that bear simple barbules. The Stage IV of this transition would have produced the differentiation of proximal and distal barbules and, therefore, closed vanes (i.e., the distal barbules developed hooks capable of interlocking with the grooved proximal barbules of the adjacent barb). Finally, further modifications of the follicle&#8217;s collar, in Stage V, would have led to the evolution of an asymmetric flight feather. In general terms, the evolutionary sequence proposed by this model corresponds well to the phylogenetic distribution of feathers in non-avian dinosaurs, namely the earliest phylogenetic divergences (e.g., <em>Sciurumimus albersdoerferi</em>, <em>Sinosauropteryx prima</em>, <em>Dilong paradoxus</em>) have structures that are morphologically similar to those of the model&#8217;s Stage I (i.e., simple protofeathers) and taxa closer to the origin of birds (e.g., paravians such as <em>Microraptor zhaoianus</em>) have more complex structures (i.e., feathers with asymmetric vanes) that correspond to Stage V (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig11">fig. 2.11</a>). As more discoveries of the plumage of non-avian theropods and their avian descendants come to light, it is becoming evident (not surprisingly) that the evolution of feathers took a more complex path than previously envisioned. Several reports of extinct feather types (Perrichot et al. 2008, O&#8217;Connor et al. 2012a) do not precisely fit Prum&#8217;s proposed model; the documented developmental pathways of modern feathers may not be able to explain the development of the variety of feathers structures seen among non-avian theropods and basal birds.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>While we have gained a significant understanding of the evolution of feathers through important paleontological and developmental evidence, the original function of the earliest feathers (or their structural precursors) remains controversial. Over the years, many different hypotheses for the original function of feathers have been put forward. Nowadays, however, explanations for the primal function of these structures are centered on two of their modern basic functions: insulating the body from the environmental conditions and providing the basis for a wide range of behavioral and sexual displays. The former hypothesis argues that feathers evolved as non-avian dinosaurs developed higher metabolic rates. Although there are clear challenges to determining with precision the thermal physiology of extinct animals, mounting evidence indicates that non-avian dinosaurs&#8212;big and small&#8212;had body temperatures that were higher than those typical of living reptiles (Eagle et al. 2015). The bone histology of these animals, for example, has consistently shown that they grew at rates that clearly exceeded those typical of turtles, lizards, and crocodiles (Varricchio 1993, Chinsamy 2005, Erickson 2005, 2014), thus suggesting higher metabolic rates than in these reptiles. Recent geochemical studies have added fresh evidence in support of this conclusion (Eagle et al. 2011, 2015). These advances have estimated that the body temperatures of non-avian dinosaurs, though variable among groups, were more elevated than those of modern ectothermic reptiles, albeit not as high as those of living endothermic birds; for this reason, non-avian dinosaurs are thought to have been metabolically &#8220;mesotherms&#8221; (Grady et al. 2014, Eagle et al. 2015). New developments have also demonstrated that many lineages of theropod dinosaurs went through a significant trend of body size reduction during the Jurassic (Lee et al. 2014a); because small-sized animals lose body heat more easily than larger ones, such a reduction in body size would have created selective pressures for the evolution of insulating structures. Therefore, if non-avian dinosaurs were transitioning toward the metabolic rates common of living birds, it is reasonable to conceive an adaptive scenario in which feathers evolved to insulate the bodies of animals (particularly those that had small sizes) that have crossed a thermal threshold; the most basic protofeathers&#8212;filament-like structures covering the bodies of the earliest known feathered dinosaurs&#8212;seem to be well-suited for this purpose, just like hair and down shield the body of modern mammals and birds, respectively.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_19"></a>Birds are renowned for their ornamental plumages and colorfulness&#8212;it is thus not surprising that some researchers have argued that feathers first evolved for the purpose of visual display. This hypothesis claims that ornamental structures and complex color patterns evolved to enhance mating competitiveness, a process that results from sexual selection. Feathers interpreted as ornamental (i.e., lacking other apparent function) have been found in association with the skeletons of a variety of non-avian theropods. These include long ribbon-like feathers attached to the tail of the paravian scansoriopterygid <em>Epidexipteryx hui</em> (Zhang et al. 2008a) and the broad filaments sparsely distributed among the protofeathers of the therizinosaur <em>B. inexpectus</em> (Xu et al. 2009). Feather coloration among these dinosaurs has been inferred from preserved microscopic structures interpreted as melanosomes, cellular organelles that in living animals store melanin (a pigment responsible for black, brown, and reddish coloration). Melanosome shape varies according to the type of melanin, and the differential concentration of melanosome types has been used to approximate the color of the feathers of some non-avian dinosaurs (as well as early birds) (Li et al. 2010, Zhang et al. 2010). While such an approach has been criticized by those who argue that shape alone is not enough to differentiate between melanosomes and similarly shaped bacteria (Lindgren et al. 2015, Schweitzer et al. 2015), which do not carry melanin and are known to mediate in the preservation of feathers and other soft structures, definitive examples of these structures have been confirmed by both their microscopic appearance and their chemical fingerprinting (Lindgren et al. 2015). The discovery of ornamental feathers together with proxies for coloration among some of the most basal feathered non-avian theropods has encouraged the notion that feathers might have evolved within the context of display, a major role feathers play in modern birds.</p>
<p class="indent">In sum, the avian feather is the result of many millions of years of evolutionary experimentation in multiple lineages of non-avian theropods and their early descendants. Some controversial evidence (i.e., integumentary coverings in non-theropod dinosaurs and pterosaurs) suggests that the origin of these quintessential avian structures may be traceable to animals that are far removed from the ancestry of birds. A well-accepted model for the evolution of modern feathers&#8212;including coverts, flight feathers, and others&#8212;has been devised, but the primal function of the earliest feathers remains controversial. Solid evidence, however, rules out flight as the driving force underlying the origin of feathers. In fact, the fossil record combined with our understanding of the evolutionary relationships of birds and their dinosaurian predecessors clearly indicates that the aerodynamic functions characteristic of modern flight feathers are the result of exaptation, an evolutionary process by which physical traits develop a new function different from the one they originally served (in the case of feathers, insulation or sexual display). The available evidence thus indicates that avian flight developed among animals that had already evolved an array of feather types, including those that would allow them to generate the forces necessary to take off.</p>
<h3 class="h3">THE ORIGIN OF AVIAN FLIGHT</h3>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_20"></a>The evolution of flight in birds, and the ecologic context of the animals that first acquired structures critical for this means of locomotion, continue to be at the center of a century-old debate that at times has been intertwined (inappropriately) with disputes surrounding the ancestry of birds. Today, numerous fossils have documented that critical flight-related characteristics&#8212;long and foldable wings, relatively small sizes, and others&#8212;arose prior to the rise of birds, as some non-avian maniraptorans decreased in body size, augmented the size of feathered forelimbs, and evolved specific structures that enabled a suite of movements akin to those of modern birds during flight.</p>
<p class="indent">For most of the history of this debate, the problem of the origin of bird flight has been polarized between two ostensibly incompatible arguments. On the one hand, those supporting the &#8220;arboreal theory&#8221; have argued that avian flight evolved through incremental stages in tree-climbing animals that leaped between branches, evolved gliding capabilities, and subsequently developed flapping flight. On the other hand, followers of the &#8220;cursorial theory&#8221; have claimed that the land-dwelling ancestors of birds never developed arboreal habits but instead evolved the ability to generate aerodynamic forces by flapping their feathered forelimbs in a fashion similar to the flight stroke of present-day birds; this view argues that the evolution of such an ability helped the land-dwelling ancestors of birds leap among fallen trees, climb rocks and other topographic heights, and increase their running speed, and in time, it allowed them to become airborne.</p>
<p class="indent">Numerous details about how the maniraptoran ancestors of birds became airborne remain unanswered, but some fundamental aspects of this evolutionary process have become clear. Fossil evidence shows that key characteristics enabling motions similar to the avian flight stroke&#8212;skeletal features that allow the distal forelimb to swivel around the wrist, to sweep the entire forelimb up and down, and to fold it in birdlike manner&#8212;were already present in a number of non-avian maniraptoran theropods. Well-preserved fossils also document that the glenoid facet of the scapulocoracoid (the shoulder socket), which faces laterally in birds and allows the wings to move up and down with significant amplitude, had already evolved among these dinosaurs. These discoveries show that regardless of the functional context in which these non-avian maniraptorans evolved such characteristics of the forelimb and shoulder&#8212;for climbing trees, grasping their prey, or other purposes&#8212;these animals had evolved the ability to perform movements similar to those of the flight stroke of living birds and, thus, to generate thrust and lift using their forelimbs (Burgers and Chiappe 1999). Fossil discoveries have also shown that feathers suitable for forming an airfoil&#8212;feathers with a strong shaft and cohesive vanes made up of tightly closed barbs&#8212;evolved among non-avian maniraptorans that were incapable of flying. For example, the vaned feathers of the oviraptorosaur <em>Caudipteryx</em> formed wings that were too small in relation to its body to produce the lift necessary for taking off. The anatomy of <em>Caudipteryx</em> also points at a ground-dwelling existence. In fact, a thorough analysis of the skeletal characteristics of both tree-climbing and terrestrial vertebrates demonstrated that many other non-avian maniraptorans (including the paravian <em>Microraptor</em>) had morphologies and skeletal proportions similar to those of terrestrial mammals and ground-based birds (Dececchi and Larsson 2011). This and other studies have provided compelling evidence indicating that the dinosaurian forerunners of birds lived primarily on the ground. The feathered forelimbs of these dinosaurs, however, could have generated a certain degree of aerodynamic forces (Burgers and Chiappe 1999; Dececchi et al. 2016) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig12">fig. 2.12</a>). Numerous land birds&#8212;including pheasants, partridges, turkeys, and megapodes&#8212;use the thrust and lift produced by their wings to ascend all sorts of objects (Dial 2003, Dial et al. 2006, 2008). Hence, fossil discoveries of the last few decades and new analyses are congruent with the main tenet of the &#8220;cursorial theory&#8221;: these findings demonstrate that the flight stroke first evolved in the ground-dwelling relatives of birds (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig12">fig. 2.12</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Fossil discoveries also suggest that not all non-avian maniraptorans were flightless. In the last two decades, a series of winged non-avian paravians from northeastern China during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous has provided evidence indicating that the origin of flight along the avian line very likely preceded the rise of birds. The troodontid <em>Anchiornis</em>, the dromaeosaurids <em>Microraptor</em> and <em>Changyuraptor</em>, and a number of other similarly small dinosaurs show how, in addition to their well-developed wings, these animals possessed a set of long, vaned feathers attached to the lower legs that formed extensive &#8220;hindwings&#8221; (Xu et al. 2003, Hu et al. 2009, Han et al. 2014) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig9">fig. 2.9</a>). The morphology of the shoulder, thorax, and wings of these dinosaurs strongly suggest that they were capable of becoming airborne; in spite of this, precisely how (e.g., gliding, flapping) and how well they flew remains controversial (Dyke et al. 2013, Han et al. 2014; Dececchi et al. 2016). Likewise, the function of their &#8220;hindwings&#8221; has also not been entirely worked out. The soundest interpretations claim that these feathers trailed behind the lower leg and that they played a role in flight control (Han et al. 2014).</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2.12.</em> Flight may have evolved as a by-product of aerodynamic forces produced by ground-dwelling dinosaurs. <em>From Chiappe 2007</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_21"></a>The discovery of non-avian paravians with well-developed &#8220;hindwings&#8221; highlights once again the degree of evolutionary experimentation that took place around the origin of birds. Nonetheless, the fact that the phylogenetic positions of the few known examples of flighted paravians remain unstable (i.e., various studies resolving them along different branches of the basal paravian tree) makes it difficult to determine whether their four-winged body plan (and inferred flight mode) was ancestral to the fore-winged body plan of birds or whether it was a specialization of some non-avian paravian lineages. Some researchers, who believe it to be a body plan ancestral to birds, have argued that the &#8220;hindwings&#8221; of basal paravians became gradually reduced during early avian evolution (Zhang and Zhou 2004, Longrich 2006, Zheng et al. 2013). These researchers ascribe the aerodynamic functions inferred for the large paravian &#8220;hindwings&#8221; to the plumage covering portions of the middle leg (i.e., the shin) of <em>Archaeopteryx</em> (Longrich 2006) and other basal birds (Zhang and Zhou 2004, Zheng et al. 2013). However, the fact that only short feathers extended down the legs of basal birds points at these being examples of &#8220;feather trousers,&#8221; common among groups of modern birds (e.g., Accipitridae, Falconidae) and with negligible (if any) aerodynamic functions.</p>
<p class="indent">Further evolutionary experimentation related to the development of flight capabilities among dinosaurs close to the origin of birds is illustrated by the bizarre scansoriopterygids, a group of diminutive non-avian paravians from China during the Jurassic (Czerkas and Yuan 2002, Zhang et al. 2002, 2008a, Xu et al. 2015). The recent discovery of the peculiar <em>Yi qi</em> (Xu et al. 2015) revealed that these animals had a unique configuration of the forelimb in which a rod-like bone projected from the wrist and was apparently connected to a skinfold. Such a finding suggested that while feathered (their bodies covered by filament-like structures frayed distally), the skeletal forelimb of the scansoriopterygids supported a membranous airfoil similar to those of present-day flying squirrels and bats (and the extinct pterosaurs) but unlike the feathered airfoil of other non-avian maniraptorans and birds. Overall, <em>Yi</em> and its relatives look much less birdlike than either the troodontids or the dromaeosaurids, yet phylogenetically they appear to be a maniraptoran divergence close to the avian clade. Although much remains to be learned about these highly specialized avian forerunners, the unusual configuration of the forelimb of <em>Y. qi</em> points at potential aerodynamic specializations unlike those of any other dinosaur, thus adding to the puzzle of how the flight of birds first evolved.</p>
<p class="indent">In sum, discoveries in the last few decades suggest that flight evolved as a byproduct of functions performed by a suite of structures that originated among flightless, land-based dinosaurs&#8212;aerial behaviors among non-avian dinosaurs may have also evolved multiple times independently (Brusatte 2017). These findings have also shown how some lineages of non-avian dinosaurs evolved a variety of structures (e.g., &#8220;hindwings,&#8221; membranous airfoils) that conferred to them the ability to fly in a very different fashion than their modern descendants. As with many attributes previously thought to be exclusive to birds, these recent fossil discoveries have demonstrated that flight (as a locomotory adaptation and with specifics notwithstanding) was also an innovation passed to their descendants by the small dinosaurian ancestors of birds.</p>
<h3 class="h3">EVOLUTIONARY AND ECOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AMONG EARLY BIRDS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Although discoveries of Mesozoic birds in the nineteenth century&#8212;the Late Jurassic <em>Archaeopteryx lithographica</em> and the Late Cretaceous <em>Hesperornis regalis</em> and <em>Ichthyornis dispar</em>&#8212;provided evidence for a very ancient origin of the group (Chiappe 1995, 2007, Feduccia 1999, Wellnhofer 2009), these fossils were limited to a handful of taxa that differed greatly anatomically and were largely restricted to nearshore and marine environments. Our poor understanding of the morphological disparity and ecological diversity of early birds remained mostly unchanged during much of the twentieth century. Such a scant fossil record led many researchers to believe that bird diversity had remained low during the Mesozoic, overshadowed by the spectacular diversity of the large dinosaurs that dominated the land ecosystems of this era. However, some key discoveries in the last few decades of the twentieth century (e.g., Elzanowski 1974, Brodkorb 1976, Walker 1981) started to document the presence of another important group of early birds&#8212;the Enantiornithes. These initial enantiornithine discoveries consisted of incomplete fossils, which in some cases were misinterpreted as belonging to modern groups (e.g., paleognaths, piciforms, and coraciiforms). Fossils of the early forerunners of modern birds&#8212;stem ornithuromorphs&#8212;were also discovered in Cretaceous sediments during the last decades of the twentieth century (e.g., Chiappe 1991, Forster et al. 1996). Consisting of rather incomplete fossils, these too were identified as belonging to modern clades in some instances (e.g., Alvarenga and Bonaparte 1992). Despite the limited (and sometimes misleading) information revealed by the studies of these fossils, their discovery helped establish the idea that the Mesozoic diversity of birds was indeed much greater than previously envisioned (Martin 1983, Chiappe 1991). This notion was to be confirmed by many subsequent discoveries, primarily from Asia.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_22"></a>Since the early 1990s, excavations at various Early Cretaceous sites in northeastern China (mostly in western Liaoning Province, but also in northeastern Hebei Province and the southeastern corner of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region) have revealed a wealth of exquisitely preserved fossils of early birds in association with an extraordinarily diverse fossil assemblage known as the Jehol Biota (Chang et al. 2003, Zhou 2014, Chiappe and Meng 2016). This explosion of fossil discoveries&#8212;together with a surge of findings of Cretaceous birds from around the world (e.g., Chiappe and Witmer 2002, Bell et al. 2010, Souza Carvalho et al. 2015)&#8212;has filled many of the anatomical, phylogenetic, and temporal gaps that existed previously (Chiappe and Dyke 2007, O&#8217;Connor et al. 2011), since the first discoveries in the 1800s (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig13">fig. 2.13</a>). The complete skeletons of these Chinese birds, often surrounded by their plumage, have enlightened our view of the ecological diversity of early birds, refined our understanding of their evolutionary relationships, and provided information about the evolution of key traits related to the life history, physiology, ecology, and locomotion of the group like no other previous evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">The new discoveries have illustrated that the vast diversity of living birds is in fact a remnant of an archaic evolutionary radiation that can be traced back to <em>Archaeopteryx</em>. This crow-sized animal still stands alone as the only record of birds in the Jurassic, and it is broadly considered the most primitive member of the group (Chiappe 1995, Wellnhofer 2009, Brussatte et al. 2015). The 150-million-year-old <em>Archaeopteryx</em> had toothed jaws, clawed wings, and a long bony tail (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig14">fig. 2.14</a>), and few features that set it apart from its paravian predecessors, to the point that some phylogenetic hypotheses have placed it within Deinonychosauria (Dromaeosauridae + Troodontidae) (e.g., Xu et al. 2011, Godefroit et al. 2013), albeit not convincingly. Computer tomography of the braincase of one fossil (<em>Archaeopteryx</em>&#8217;s London specimen) reveals a brain that is comparable in relative size and architecture to those of its non-avian maniraptoran predecessors but substantially larger and more complex than those of more primitive dinosaurs. Details of the inner ear also indicate that <em>Archaeopteryx</em> was able to move in a three-dimensional space in ways comparable to present-day birds (Dominguez Alonso et al. 2004). These studies have shown that <em>Archaeopteryx</em> (and its non-avian maniraptoran relatives) had evolved the degree of neurological complexity required for flight (Balanoff et al. 2013). Additionally, <em>Archaeopteryx</em> had proportionally larger wings (and therefore, lower wing-loading) when compared with non-avian maniraptorans of similar size. Nonetheless, the body plan of the earliest bird suggests an aerodynamic performance similar to that of landfowl, rails, and other heavy fliers. In fact, new estimations of the wing-loading and wingbeat frequency of extinct birds based on the statistical relationship between these aerodynamic parameters and the proportions of the wing bones in modern birds suggest that <em>Archaeopteryx</em> was most likely incapable of any prolonged flapping flight.</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2.14</em>. Skeletal reconstructions of <em>Archaeopteryx lithographica</em> and <em>Jeholornis prima</em>, two basal lineages of long bony-tailed birds.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_23"></a>New discoveries from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota have revealed that other primitive avians with long bony tails preceded the evolution of birds with an abbreviated bony tail, one composed of fewer vertebrae ending in a pygostyle (the structure that supports the rectricial bulbs that anchor the flight feathers of the tail). Several taxa have been named based on fossils unearthed from 120- to 125-million-year-old deposits of northeastern China (e.g., <em>Jeholornis prima</em>, <em>J. palmapenis</em>, <em>J. curvipes</em>, <em>Shenzhouraptor sinensis</em>, <em>Jixiangornis orientalis</em>) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig15">fig. 2.15</a>). Nonetheless, the similarity of these fossils suggests they are all members of the Jeholornithidae (most likely just <em>Jeholornis</em>), a clade that was named in honor of the Jehol Biota. With a size similar to that of a turkey, the best-known species of this clade, <em>Jeholornis prima</em> (Zhou and Zhang 2002a, 2003a) had a relatively tall skull with small teeth on the maxillae and at the tip of the dentaries, and wings ending in three clawed fingers. The overall morphology of the skeleton of <em>Jeholornis</em> was very primitive with respect to that of modern birds; nonetheless, it displayed several advanced characteristics&#8212;particularly in the shoulder girdle and forelimb&#8212;when compared with <em>Archaeopteryx</em> (Zhou and Zhang 2003a) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig14">fig. 2.14</a>). Despite these morphological advances, the tail of <em>Jeholornis</em> was proportionally longer (with a greater number of vertebrae) than that of <em>Archaeopteryx</em> (Zhou and Zhang 2003a). The tail feathers were also differently organized: unlike the broad, frond-like feathered tail of <em>Archaeopteryx</em>, the feathered tail of the jeholornithids was narrower, and it ended in either a terminal fan (e.g., <em>J. prima</em>) or in a palm-like arrangement of feathers (e.g., <em>J. palmapenis</em>) (O&#8217;Connor et al. 2012b). Such differences in the size of the caudal airfoil indicate that the tail of <em>Jeholornis</em> was able to generate less lift than that of <em>Archaeopteryx</em>, which in turn points to the wings of <em>Jeholornis</em> playing a more important role in the generation of aerodynamic forces. Characteristics of their plumage, their large wings, and details of their &#8220;flight-ready&#8221; brains indicate that <em>Archaeopteryx</em> and <em>Jeholornis</em> had a degree of aerial proficiency. Comparisons with a variety of living vertebrates that lived on either trees or the ground (Dececchi and Larsson 2011) suggest that <em>Archaeopteryx</em> and <em>Jeholornis</em> were predominantly land dwellers. All things considered, these animals might have been able to fly for short distances, requiring either a take-off run or an elevated launch to become airborne (Burgers and Chiappe 1999) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig12">fig. 2.12</a>).</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_24"></a>A large ensemble of more advanced birds with abbreviated bony tails is also known from the Jehol Biota (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig13">fig. 2.13</a>). The varying morphology of the skulls, teeth, wings, and feet of these fossils indicates that even at this early phase of their evolutionary history, birds had expanded into a wide range of ecological niches. Important evolutionary innovations evident in the wings, shoulders, and tails of these 131- to 120-million-year-old fossils also indicate that birds evolved sophisticated flying capabilities soon after <em>Archaeopteryx</em>; such aerodynamic improvements most likely influenced the ecological diversification witnessed by the Jehol avifauna.</p>
<p class="indent">Paramount among these flight-correlated transformations was the abbreviation of the tail and the development of a pygostyle (a platelike, compound bone at the end of the tail that in modern birds supports the fatty rectricial bulbs also known as the pope&#8217;s nose; see Gill 2007). The reduction of the bony tail moved the center of gravity forward, decoupling the function that the tail had in terrestrial locomotion and transforming its aerodynamic role (Gatesy and Dial 1996)&#8212;namely, the reduction of the tail led to new ways of walking and flying. Such a skeletal abbreviation most likely took place in concert with developments in the forelimbs that boosted the wings&#8217; role in flight control as the latter became responsible for the subtle adjustments (in the wing planform, angle of attack, and others) that are critical for aerial proficiency. Evidence for this is hinted by the large size and shape of wings of the most primitive short-tailed birds&#8212;confuciusornithids and sapeornithids&#8212;that are recorded in the Jehol Biota (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig16">fig. 2.16</a>). Unfortunately, little is known about the evolutionary pattern by which the avian tail was reduced. One fossil from the Jehol Biota, the 125-million-year-old <em>Zhongornis haoae</em> (Gao et al. 2008), suggests that the reduction in the number of caudal vertebrae pre-dated the evolution of the pygostyle. New developmental studies have the promise of clarifying aspects of this important transformation (Rashid et al. 2014); nonetheless, additional fossil evidence is needed to elucidate more precisely when and how the abbreviation of the tail (and the evolution of the pygostyle) took place during the early evolution of birds.</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2.16.</em> Skeletal reconstructions of the most basal pygostylian lineages: <em>Confuciusornis sanctus</em> and <em>Sapeornis chaoyangensis.</em></p>
<p class="indent">The 125-million-year-old <em>Confuciusornis sanctus</em> (Chiappe et al. 1999)&#8212;known from hundreds of specimens from the Jehol Biota&#8212;is possibly the most primitive known pygostylian (the group containing all birds with a pygostyle, including living ones) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig17">fig. 2.17</a>). A handful of other confuciusornithids (e.g., <em>Changchengornis hengdaoziensis</em>, <em>Eoconfuciusornis zhengi</em>) are also known from the Jehol Biota (Ji et al. 1999, Zhang et al. 2008b). These jay- to crow-sized birds had strong forelimbs ending in long hands with enormous claws, elongated wings of high aspect ratio, and stout jaws lacking teeth (Chiappe et al. 1999, Chiappe 2007) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig16">fig. 2.16</a>); in fact, the confuciusornithids are the earliest examples of fully beaked birds. The less abundant and phylogenetically more derived <em>Sapeornis chaoyangensis</em> (Zhou and Zhang 2002b, 2003b, Gao et al. 2012b), also from the Jehol Biota, had long wings as well; these, however, were much broader than the tapering wings of the confuciusornithids. In fact, a recent study combining computational modeling and morphofunctional analyses suggests that <em>Sapeornis</em> would have been able to use its broad wings for soaring on continental thermals (Serrano and Chiappe 2017). Several species of sapeornithids have been named (e.g., <em>Didactylornis jii</em>, <em>Sapeornis angustis</em>, <em>Omnivoropteryx sinousaorum</em>, <em>Shenshiornis primita</em>), although all these are likely synonyms of <em>Sapeornis chaoyangensis</em> (Gao et al. 2012b, Pu et al. 2013). Reaching a size similar to that of a large gull (e.g., <em>Larus occidentalis</em>), <em>Sapeornis</em> was larger than <em>Confuciusornis</em>. Its tall skull had a few spade-shaped teeth; the forelimbs were long and carried large claws on only two fingers (inner and middle), and the feet had powerfully grasping toes (Zhou and Zhang 2003b, Gao et al. 2012b, Pu et al. 2013, Chiappe and Meng 2016) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig16">fig. 2.16</a>). The wings of both <em>Sapeornis</em> and <em>Confuciusornis</em> also showed an additional skinfold, the propatagium, which connected the wrist with the shoulder (Chiappe et al. 1999, Chiappe and Meng 2016) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig16">fig. 2.16</a>). This delta-shaped skinfold, either absent or poorly developed in both <em>Archaeopteryx</em> and <em>Jeholornis</em>, would have increased the surface area and, hence, the lift-generating capabilities, of the wing. While the wing bones of these early pygostylians show many primitive anatomical details when compared with those of modern birds, the proportionally larger size of their wings and their reduced bony tail suggest that the flight performance of these birds was superior to that of their long bony-tailed predecessors (Serrano et al. 2017, Serrano and Chiappe 2017).</p>
<figure class="imagef" id="ch2fig17"><img src="../images/Figure_2.17.jpg" alt="Images"/></figure>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2.17. Confuciusornis sanctus</em>, male (with ornamental tail feathers) and female (without ornamental tail feathers).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_25"></a>The hundreds of known fossils of <em>Confuciusornis sanctus</em> include some that are almost half the size of others (based on linear measurements of long bones), yet all of them belong to fledged individuals that are anatomically indistinguishable from one another. Such an extensive growth series indicates that, unlike most living birds, <em>C. sanctus</em> (and presumably its close relatives) grew over several years before becoming full-grown (Chiappe et al. 2008, Marugan-Lobon et al. 2011). The same growth pattern can be inferred for <em>Sapeornis chaoyangensis</em>, for which a similar growth series is known, albeit one in which the size of the specimens falls within a narrower range (Gao et al. 2012b, Pu et al. 2013). These life history inferences are also supported by histological studies of their bone tissues, which reveal annual growth rings (lines of arrested growth), indicating that <em>Confuciusornis</em> and <em>Sapeornis</em> grew over multiple years.</p>
<p class="indent">The extraordinary sample of <em>C. sanctus</em> also shows that some specimens carried a pair of long ornamental feathers projecting from the tail, while others had unornamented tails (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig17">fig. 2.17</a>). The discovery of medullary bone (a female-only type of bone tissue) in a specimen lacking these feathers (Chinsamy et al. 2013) has provided support to the interpretation of this differential plumage as evidence of sexual dimorphism, in which ornamented specimens are regarded as males (Chiappe et al. 1999, Marugan-Lobon et al. 2011). Furthermore, the fact that these ornamental tail feathers (a secondary sexual trait that could be used as a proxy for the onset of sexual maturity) are observed in specimens of <em>C. sanctus</em> that are significantly smaller than the largest known specimens of this species indicates that, unlike modern birds, these ancient birds begun reproducing well before they reached full-grown size (Chinsamy et al. 2013), a reproductive pattern inherited from their dinosaurian forerunners (Lee and Werning 2008, Makovicky and Zanno 2011) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig18">fig. 2.18</a>).</p>

The star points at a female for which the gender was confirmed histologically by the discovery of medullary bone. The onset of sexual maturity is inferred by the presence of ornamental feathers in individuals interpreted as males. The available evidence suggests that early birds such as <em>Confuciusornis sanctus</em> reached sexual maturity prior to reaching somatic maturity. <em>From Chinsamy et al. 2013</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_26"></a>A great variety of more modern-looking birds are also recorded in the Jehol Biota. Among these fossils are the earliest records of enantiornithines worldwide (e.g., <em>Protopteryx fengningensis</em>, <em>Eopengornis martini</em>) (Zhang and Zhou 2000, Wang et al. 2014), which are found in 131-million-year-old layers representing the earliest phases of the Jehol Biota. The enantiornithines represent the largest radiation of premodern birds (Chiappe and Walker 2002). As mentioned above, these birds were not recognized as a distinct clade until the early 1980s (Walker 1981); the more than 70 enantiornithine species named in the last 35 years are a testimony to the remarkable burst of recent discoveries of Mesozoic birds (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig19">fig. 2.19</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Enantiornithine fossils are indeed extremely abundant in the fine sediments of Jehol Biota. These rocks alone have yielded the remains of an embryo (Zhou and Zhang 2004), numerous hatchlings (e.g., Chiappe et al. 2007, Zheng et al. 2012), and hundreds of subadult and adult individuals (including the holotypes of more than 30 named species; see Chiappe and Meng 2016). Yet, fossils of these birds are known from Cretaceous deposits in every continent except Antarctica (Chiappe and Walker 2002) and tantalizing discoveries in 100-million-year-old amber are revealing exceptional details of their anatomy (Xing et al. 2016, 2017). The abundant fossil record of this diverse clade shows that during their long evolutionary history&#8212;approximately from 131 to 66 million years ago&#8212;the enantiornithines evolved many different lifestyles and ecological specializations, inhabiting a variety of environments (from deserts to temperate forests and from marshes to oceanic littorals).</p>
<p class="indent">The skulls of most enantiornithines were toothed (upper and lower jaws), although the teeth differ greatly in morphology, size, and position within the jaws (O&#8217;Connor and Chiappe 2011) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig20">fig. 2.20</a>). The skeletal anatomy of their wings evolved proportions approaching those of living birds, but the forelimbs retained small claws on two of the three fingers (inner and middle) (Chiappe and Walker 2002) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig21">fig. 2.21</a>). The feet of most enantiornithines unmistakably show grasping capabilities; their perching design is consistent with the general interpretation of these birds as tree-dwellers (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig19">fig. 2.19</a>). Some taxa, however, show different pedal morphologies indicating that wading and swimming lifestyles also evolved among these birds (Chiappe 1993). A variety of feeding specializations (e.g., insectivory, durophagy, and piscivory, among others) are also interpreted on the basis of the morphology of their jaws and teeth (O&#8217;Connor and Chiappe 2011) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig20">fig. 2.20</a>). Some small Jehol enantiornithines (e.g., <em>Longirostravis hani</em>, <em>Shanweiniao cooperorum</em>, <em>Rapaxavis pani</em>) with long and delicate snouts carrying tiny peg-like teeth at their tips (Hou et al. 2004, Morschauser et al. 2009, O&#8217;Connor et al. 2009) have been consistently interpreted as mud probers that foraged along lakeshores (Chiappe and Meng 2016). Coeval sites in South Korea reveal a diversity of probing traces (mixed with avian webbed footprints) documenting that different types of birds had evolved probing feeding behaviors by the Early Cretaceous (Falk et al. 2014). Gut contents and other associated evidence of diet are exceedingly rare among enantiornithines. Nonetheless, the available evidence suggests that some of these birds had highly specialized feeding behaviors (Sanz et al. 1996, Wang et al. 2016a), including sap eating (Dalla Vecchia and Chiappe 2002).</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_27"></a>Enantiornithines also evolved important innovations in their plumage and skeletal flight apparatus. Their wings carried flight feathers (primaries and secondaries) similar in number and arrangement to those of today&#8217;s flying birds. Their shoulder bones developed features that would have imparted more power to the muscles most responsible for the wing stroke. Rare fossils show evidence of an alula (a tuft of small feathers attached to the inner finger), which forms a leading-edge slot that enhances low-speed flight when deployed (critical during their takeoff and landing) (Sanz et al. 1996); they have also shown that these birds had evolved a modern-looking network of ligaments and muscles, which in living birds controls the movements of the flight feathers (Navalon et al. 2015). The feathered tail of enantiornithines varied significantly (O&#8217;Connor et al. 2016), although most fossils from the Jehol Biota had a wedge-like tail composed of down-like feathers and a pair of long ornamental feathers (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig22">fig. 2.22</a>). Such tails clearly lacked any aerodynamic function. Nonetheless, in two taxa (<em>Shanweiniao cooperorum</em> and <em>Chiappeavis magnapremaxillo</em>) the feathered tail included several pairs of shafted feathers capable of generating lift and playing a more significant aerodynamic role (O&#8217;Connor et al. 2009, 2016). The presence of these aerodynamic tails in at least two enantiornithines suggests that these birds may have evolved a version of rectricial bulbs, the fatty structure anchored by the pygostyle that in modern birds plays a key role in controlling the fanning of the feathered tail. However, soft tissues visible around the pygostyle of some exceptionally preserved fossils do not reveal the presence of well-formed rectricial bulbs, suggesting that these were not developed in many enantiornithines. In sum, the development of a more compact distal segment of the forelimb carrying modern-looking skinfolds and an alula, the modern proportions of wing bones, the important modifications of their shoulder girdle (related to the size and functioning of the flight muscles), and the presence in some taxa of an aerodynamic tail are some of the most noticeable transformations shown by these birds when compared with the most primitive short-tailed birds (e.g., <em>Confuciusornis</em>, <em>Sapeornis</em>). Furthermore, while their sizes ranged significantly during their long evolutionary history (from that of a small songbird to that of a vulture), many Jehol enantiornithines were substantially smaller than the most primitive short-tailed birds (e.g., <em>Confuciusornis</em>, <em>Sapeornis</em>). The miniaturization experienced by the earliest enantiornithines has a well-understood functional significance: flight performance correlates positively with size reduction. Furthermore, smaller birds&#8212;typically with comparatively smaller wing-loading&#8212;are more maneuverable, and their flight is energetically more efficient. Estimates for the wing-loadings of enantiornithines are significantly lower than for those of either <em>Sapeornis</em> or <em>Confuciusornis</em>, evidence that once again underscores the superior flight competence of the former. In all, the significant transformations of the skeleton, plumage, and dimensions of these birds suggest that, even at the onset of their evolutionary history, enantiornithines were able to fly in ways similar to those seen among small living birds. It is most likely that the evolution of these enhanced flying capabilities played a key role in the evolutionary success of the enantiornithines, which by about 120 million years ago seem to have risen to dominance.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_28"></a>A wealth of other enantiornithine fossils shows key evidence for understanding several aspects of their biology. An embryo and multiple hatchlings from the Jehol Biota (Zhou and Zhang 2004, Chiappe et al. 2007), a neonate contained in mid-Cretaceous amber (Xing et al. 2017), and histological evidence from other fossils, indicate that most enantiornithines had precocial hatching strategies in which their chicks were nidifugous, able to find food by themselves, and capable of flying soon after they hatched. The exceptional preservation of the Jehol Biota has also revealed some cases in which ovarian follicles have been preserved; these remarkable fossils tell us that enantiornithines had reproductive physiologies involving hierarchical ovulation (O&#8217;Connor et al. 2013). Some researchers (e.g., Zheng et al. 2013, Wang et al. 2016b) have argued that these fossils also show evidence of a reduced right ovary (an adaptation typical of most living birds; Gill 2007). Nonetheless, the preservation of the known specimens with these structures makes this interpretation problematic (it is questionable whether ovaries from either side can be individualized in laterally preserved specimens). The different examples of these birds with ornamental tail feathers (e.g., Zhang and Zhou 2000, Souza Carvalho et al. 2015) and their differing morphology (Wang et al. 2014) suggest the presence of sexually dimorphic species and mating systems in which ornamentation plumage played an important role.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_29"></a>Rocks from the Early Cretaceous also record a number of transitional fossils that heralded the evolution of the closest relatives of modern birds (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig13">fig. 2.13</a>). In some respects these primitive ornithuromorphs resemble the enantiornithines, but their skeletons show for the first time clear trademarks of their living counterparts. The majority of these primitive ornithuromorphs were lightly built flying birds, whose sizes tended to be larger than those of the contemporaneous enantiornithines. Like the latter, both their skeletons and plumage showed clear evidence of enhanced aerodynamic capabilities. It is within these birds that we witness the origin of the extremely fast rates of body maturation characteristic of modern birds, which reach their full body size within a year after hatching.</p>
<p class="indent">Many studies have supported a sister-group relationship between the enantiornithines and the ornithuromorphs (e.g., Chiappe 1996, 2002, Gao et al. 2008, O&#8217;Connor and Zhou 2012); the latter clade includes all living birds and a number of Mesozoic lineages that are more closely related to modern avians than to the enantiornithines (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig13">fig. 2.13</a>). Ornithuromorphs and enantiornithines split from a shared ancestor that most likely had already evolved key traits with advanced aerodynamic functions. Like the enantiornithines, the earliest ornithuromorphs&#8212;known from throughout the Jehol Biota&#8212;had wing bones of modern proportions (those from the forearm were the longest and those from the hand formed a compact unit, a design best for thrust generation). The morphology of the shoulder girdle and the size of the keeled breastbone indicate that even the earliest ornithuromorphs (<em>Archaeornithura meemannae</em>, <em>Archaeorhynchus spathula</em>, and <em>Xinghaiornis lini</em>, among other Jehol species) (Zhou and Zhang 2006, Zhou et al. 2013, Wang et al. 2013, 2015) had strong flight muscles capable of elevating and depressing their wings with large amplitude. They also had evolved adaptations for landing, as shown by the modernization of the skeletal anatomy of the pelvis and hindlimb. Fossils with well-preserved plumage also show that these archaic birds had large wings (with moderate aspect ratios and an alula) and aerodynamic tails capable of fanning their feathers (Chiappe et al. 2014) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig22">fig. 2.22</a>). Their short pygostyle most likely supported a version of the rectricial bulbs, which muscles controlled the fanning of the rectrices (main caudal feathers), thus adjusting it to the requirements of flight. In all, the anatomy of the Jehol ornithuromorphs, which include the oldest known members of this main avian clade, indicates that these birds evolved aerodynamic surfaces and flight modes comparable to those of many modern birds more than 130 million years ago (Chiappe et al. 2014) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig23">fig. 2.23</a>).</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2.24.</em> Skeletal reconstruction of <em>Gansus zheni</em>. This taxon is phylogenetically more closely related to modern birds than any other Early Cretaceous bird from the Jehol Biota.</p>
<p class="indent">Fossils of Jehol ornithuromorphs document several stages of the evolution of the group that includes all living birds; phylogenetically, their different lineages constitute successive outgroups to the neornithine clade. On the one hand, the most basal ornithuromorph&#8212;the 125-million-year-old Jehol <em>Archaeorhynchus spathula</em> (Zhou and Zhang 2006)&#8212;possesses morphologies that are highly reminiscent of contemporaneous enantiornithines from the Jehol Biota, thus indicating a proximity to the split between ornithuromorphs and enantiornithines. On the other hand, the anatomically modern <em>Gansus zheni</em> (Liu et al. 2014) and <em>Iteravis huchzermeyeri</em> (Zhou et al. 2014)&#8212;possibly two synonymous species&#8212;represent a very close outgroup of the neornithine clade (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig24">fig. 2.24</a>). Fossils of the Jehol ornithuromorphs reveal that, early in their evolutionary history, these birds differed ecologically from their coeval enantiornithines. In contrast to the small sizes and perching adaptations typical of the latter, the most basal lineages of ornithuromorphs show larger sizes and anatomical structures that are better adapted for either a semiaquatic or a terrestrial existence (Zhou et al. 2012, 2013, Chiappe et al. 2014).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_30"></a>Several other lineages of stem ornithuromorphs are known from younger Cretaceous rocks (e.g., Chiappe 1996, Norell and Clarke 2001, Bell et al. 2010). One of these groups, the hesperornithiforms, includes a large radiation of medium-to-large toothed birds found in sediments deposited at the bottom of shallow seas and near shore environments in North America and Asia (Marsh 1880, Bell 2013). These animals, with flight capabilities from reduced to none and foot-propelled swimming specializations, are often compared to living diving birds such as grebes and loons (indeed, these three lineages have evolved a number of convergent morphologies in their hindlimbs and pelves). Albeit entirely restricted to the aquatic realm, these birds had a rich evolutionary history represented by more than 20 species that, collectively, span from about 113 million years ago to the latest Cretaceous mass extinction, 65.5 million years ago (Bell and Chiappe 2015). During this long history, the hesperornithiforms transitioned from birds with limited diving capabilities and, at best, rudimentary flight performance to flightless animals with highly advanced diving specializations. Throughout their evolution, these birds also experienced multiple independent events of body size escalation that were uncorrelated with the stepwise acquisition of diving adaptations (Bell and Chiappe 2015). These advanced diving capabilities are best illustrated by the skeletal anatomy of <em>Hesperornis regalis</em> (Marsh 1880) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig25">fig. 2.25</a>), a species that reached the length of an Emperor Penguin (<em>Aptenodytes forsteri</em>). Despite this, and the fact that hesperornithiforms had teeth in the maxillae and dentaries, and highly unusual cranial features (Elzanowski 1991), the overall morphology of their skeletons was in many respects modern-looking to the point that some studies have identified these birds as members of modern lineages (e.g., Cracraft 1982). Current studies, however, overwhelmingly support their phylogenetic placement as a close outgroup of the modern bird clade (neornithines) (e.g., O&#8217;Connor and Zhou 2012, Liu et al. 2014, Bell and Chiappe 2015). Other close outgroups of neornithines include <em>Ichthyornis dispar</em> (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig25">fig. 2.25</a>), which in most anatomical details represents a step closer to modern birds than the hesperornithiforms. Despite the advanced degree of modernization of the skeleton, this small flying bird retained teeth in the maxillae and dentaries. Abundant remains of <em>Ichthyornis</em> have been found in many of the same sites that contain the remains of <em>Hesperornis regalis</em> (Clarke 2004), with which it shared the nearshore and littoral environments of the Western Interior Seaway, a shallow sea that flooded much of North America during the Late Cretaceous.</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2.25.</em> Skeletal reconstructions of the Late Cretaceous <em>Hesperornis regalis</em> and <em>Ichthyornis dispar</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_31"></a>In addition to the large diversity of premodern birds that lived during the Mesozoic, early representatives of present-day lineages have also been unearthed in rocks from the last part of the Cretaceous period (Hope 2002, Kurochkin et al. 2002, Clarke et al. 2005, Ksepka and Clarke 2015). The divergence of early neornithine lineages in pre-Cenozoic times has been inferred from many molecular phylogenies, which have consistently concluded that modern birds first differentiated more than 100 million years ago, in the Early Cretaceous (e.g., Cooper and Penny 1997, Lee et al. 2014b, Jarvis et al. 2014). While documenting the existence of some early divergences prior to the end of the Mesozoic, even the oldest Late Cretaceous neornithines are many millions of years younger than the origin of the group as predicted by molecular studies (Mayr 2014, Ksepka and Clarke 2015). Such discrepancy has been somewhat mitigated by the discovery of the Jehol gansuids (e.g., <em>Gansus zheni</em> and <em>Iteravis huchzermeyeri</em>) (<a href="ch2.html#ch2fig26">fig. 2.26</a>), which are remarkably modern looking and yet lived 120 million years ago. While Early Cretaceous fossils that can be confidently identified as belonging to modern lineages are yet to be found, the existence of close relatives of neornithines at such an early phase of avian evolution eases the discrepancy between the molecular and paleontological inferences in what refers to the origin of modern birds (Liu et al. 2014).</p>
<p class="indent">The factors that led to the survival of the earliest neornithine divergences through the end-Cretaceous mass extinction remain unknown, but the fossil record shows that most major clades of modern birds (corresponding to traditional neornithine orders) had already originated 50 to 55 million years ago (Mayr 2009, Ksepka and Clarke 2015). Molecular inferences indicate that the last descendants of the dinosaurian radiation that started more than 230 million years ago (Brusatte et al. 2010) underwent a large diversification event at the beginning of the Paleogene (early in the Cenozoic era) (Prum et al. 2015). This explosive radiation of neornithines in the aftermath of the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction established the foundations for the morphological disparity and ecological diversity of today&#8217;s birds, recapitulating the evolution of lifestyles that characterized many archaic lineages of birds that had thrived millions of years earlier, during the Mesozoic era.</p>

<h3 class="h3">BIRDS AS LIVING DINOSAURS</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the last few decades, our understanding of the origin and subsequent diversification of birds has advanced at an unparalleled pace. A wealth of new evidence now shows that many of the features previously considered avian trademarks first evolved within theropod dinosaurs. The strength of the hypothesis that birds evolved within the maniraptoran theropods is demonstrated by the convergent results of a diversity of studies within a multitude of scientific disciplines. Today, the theropod origin of birds is supported by disparate evidence ranging from skeletal anatomy to molecular data. This evolutionary conclusion indicates that modern birds are but a branch of the tree of dinosaurs.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_32"></a>Modern feathers&#8212;already present among the closest dinosaurian relatives of birds&#8212;evolved as the result of stepwise transformations at the follicle level, which led to increased feather complexity. While the primary function of the feather remains controversial, compelling evidence indicates that simple filamentous feathers covered the bodies of many non-avian theropods and that these structures did not originate for the purpose of flight. Feathers evolved aerodynamic morphologies (shaft and cohesive vanes) and functions as some non-volant theropod dinosaurs developed airfoils with the capability of generating flight forces. Thus, flight could have evolved as a by-product of the aerodynamic forces generated by the feathered wings of non-avian maniraptorans and as a result of changes in wing-loading (the result of an evolutionary trend toward smaller body sizes and larger wing surfaces). A diversity of non-avian dinosaur lineages close to the origin of birds (<em>Microraptor</em>, <em>Yi</em>, and others) experimented with different flight modalities&#8212;perhaps evolving independently&#8212;based on structures that lack analogues among living birds; theories on the flight performance of these animals remain contentious. Over the subsequent course of evolution, the refinement of flight involved numerous transformations, including not only modifications in the skeleton and plumage but also changes in physiology, musculature, and sensory perception. While the specifics of their flight modes and performance are far from being fully understood, evidence from a number of premodern lineages suggests that birds reached flight capabilities similar to those of their living relatives very early in their evolutionary history.</p>
<p class="indent">A wealth of new discoveries of Mesozoic avian lineages&#8212;from rocks greatly separated in time and distributed across the globe&#8212;has documented an enormous morphological and ecological diversity among the early predecessors of modern birds. These discoveries have helped us understand the incremental refinement of the aerodynamic tool kit of birds and the origin of key traits related to their life history and physiology. Fossils from the Mesozoic have also documented the earliest divergences of modern birds, providing evidence for the deep origin of the group. The transformations experienced by the numerous lineages of birds that diverged, evolved, and became extinct during the Mesozoic led to the development of the modern avian body plan and set the evolutionary stage for the main diversification of present-day lineages in post-Cretaceous times.</p>
<p class="indent">In all, a spectacular array of fossils discovered worldwide has consolidated the notion that birds have a deep evolutionary history rooted among the magnificent dinosaurs of the Mesozoic; these discoveries have documented the stepwise nature of one of the most fascinating evolutionary transitions in the history of life, one connecting animals akin to <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> with the diversity of today&#8217;s birds.</p>
<h4 class="h4">KEY POINTS</h4>
<p class="bull">&#8226;<span class="space1"/><span class="space1"/><span class="space1"/>Birds are living dinosaurs. A wealth of evidence, from diverse morphological traits to genome size, support the hypothesis that birds are evolutionarily nested within theropod dinosaurs, with dromaeosaurids and troodontids as their closest relatives.</p>
<p class="bull">&#8226;<span class="space1"/><span class="space1"/><span class="space1"/>Many of the typical characteristics of birds, including feathers, brooding, and flight, had their earliest manifestations among birds&#8217; dinosaurian forerunners. Many of the unique adaptations of the avian body&#8212;rapid growth, large egg volume, and endothermy, among others&#8212;evolved in a stepwise fashion over millions of years.</p>
<p class="bull">&#8226;<span class="space1"/><span class="space1"/><span class="space1"/>Avian flight evolved from small-sized, ground-dwelling theropod dinosaurs capable of generating aerodynamic forces with feathered wings. While flight refinement during avian evolution appears to have followed a stepwise fashion, different flight modes were attained early in the history of birds.</p>
<p class="bull">&#8226;<span class="space1"/><span class="space1"/><span class="space1"/>Numerous lineages of early, premodern birds diverged, radiated, and became extinct during the Mesozoic era. Fossils of these archaic groups provide evidence of a wide range of ecological differentiation.</p>
<p class="bull">&#8226;<span class="space1"/><span class="space1"/><span class="space1"/>Modern birds originated in the Cretaceous, more than 80 million years ago. While the Mesozoic diversity of these birds remained low and limited to a few basal lineages, these birds experienced an extraordinary radiation in the aftermath of the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction.</p>
<p class="bull">&#8226;<span class="space1"/><span class="space1"/><span class="space1"/>The fossil record of Mesozoic birds, and of their dinosaurian predecessors, provides a deep-time, historical context for conservation efforts on the only living descendants of the magnificent dinosaurs that dominated the world&#8217;s terrestrial vertebrate faunas across more than 150 million years.</p>
