<title><?docpage num="xii"?><?docpage num="xiii"?>Preface for Educators</title>
<para>There are so many books already available for courses on human sexuality; why would anyone want to write another? Of course there is always pressure to publish or a fairly understandable desire to make some money, but this book was not written for those purposes. The ten case studies in this text were written to help college students understand how the academically separated areas of human sexuality integrate in real individual lives.</para>
<para>These case studies extend the kind of sex education provided by the standard college texts on human sexuality. Most sexuality texts provide students with chapters analyzing particular dimensions of human sexual activity. By reading these case studies, students can gain an integrated perspective on human sexuality as well as on their own sexual development.</para>
<para>I believe this book represents a dramatic new departure from current college texts on sexuality because while it deals with the issues covered in a standard text, it also shows precisely how these issues are actually integral in the lives of real people. At the end of each case study, an analysis section links key developmental issues with contemporary literature on that issue. These analysis sections allow students with particular interests or issues of their own to pursue them further. Following each analysis section there are discussion questions designed to encourage students individually and collectively to explore an extended range of developmental issues pertaining to human sexuality. If your students take the time to consider these discussion questions, their understanding of sexual development will increase dramatically. This new approach makes the book a perfect companion to most of the standard texts available.</para>
<para>For the thousands of students who have taken my human sexuality courses at the University of Colorado, the University of Oklahoma, and Northern Arizona University, these case studies have provided profound and important insights into the development of sexual relationships. My students tell me that the cases have been interesting to read, and have dramatically increased their understanding of how we as humans come to construct the web of social meanings that compose our sexuality.</para>
<para>In teaching sexuality classes ranging from twenty students to twelve <?docpage num="xiv"?>hundred students, I have found these case studies useful in different ways. In smaller classes they can be incorporated directly into ongoing class discussions as a valuable learning tool. With larger classes, discussions are often limited by the sheer size of the group; in this context, I have found the case studies extremely useful for outside-of-class discussion groups of eight to ten students or recitation sections.</para>
<para>Several of my colleagues teaching human sexuality courses at other institutions were initially skeptical about how these case studies would fit in with their varied course formats and texts. After trying a case study or two, most found that they added a lively and provocative stimulus to their courses. For professors who enjoy exploring new and innovative ways to integrate concepts and ideas, these case studies will prove interesting.</para>
<para>For me, teaching is a continuous process of refinement and innovation. I look forward to hearing from you to learn how <emphasis role="italic">Different Sexual Worlds</emphasis> affected your course on human sexuality.</para>

<chapter xml:id="ch00">
<title><?docpage num="xv"?>Introduction for Students</title>
<para>What does sex mean to you? Who or what helps you define your sexuality? Have you ever wondered what a prostitute thinks about sex? Have you ever wondered how a celibate priest deals with his sexual feelings? In your opinion what would constitute a great sexual relationship?</para>
<para>If these questions seem either important or intriguing, you will find this book extremely useful in extending your understanding of the social processes that shape everyone&#x2019;s sexuality.</para>
<para>I was in one of those trendy comedy clubs recently, and a young comedian was developing a joke about a male and female horse that had just finished having sex together. As the joke progressed, the male horse was trying to figure out what his recent sexual encounter &#x201C;meant.&#x201D; Was it true love, or did she have eyes for other horses? Did she think he, as a horse, was adequate? Was she just using him for a quick romp in the hay? And so on. The audience found this fairly funny simply because nobody believes that horses get this complicated in thinking about their sex lives. But of course we humans do. And the variety of meanings and complexity found in human sexuality will amaze you. Our sexuality is an important dimension of our humanity. Sexuality is often intertwined with some of our most significant and positive feelings of loving, caring, pleasure, and commitment. Conversely, one&#x2019;s sexuality can also generate the most extreme feelings of rejection, unworthiness, inadequacy, and personal alienation.</para>
<para>This book contains ten case studies that show how these contributing individuals experienced and developed their sexual lives. The focus throughout this book is on <emphasis role="italic">understanding what sex means</emphasis> in people&#x2019;s lives, and on understanding the diversity of sexual life-styles that are possible.</para>
<para>The subjects included in this book represent a wide variety and were chosen from more than two hundred subjects I interviewed about their sexuality: the spectrum of human sexual development is far greater and more complex than most of us initially suspect. This diversity is presented <?docpage num="xvi"?>in actual lives so that you can see what a priest and a prostitute might have in common or how a rock and roll star might sacrifice personalized sex for flash. The point is that by studying many different sexual lifestyles, we begin to understand the way sexual meanings are constructed in our own lives.</para>
<para>The only biases that have intruded in these case studies are my own against coercive or violent sex and the caveat that I believe sex should occur between mutually consenting adults. The book includes a case of an older and very successful businessman, a young woman who discovered early in adolescence that she was a lesbian, a gay man who is currently dying of AIDS, a celibate Catholic priest, a professor who led a very rambunctious and radical sexual life, and a woman who entered a traditional marriage and later found it highly unsatisfactory. Included are the old and the relatively young, the sexually fulfilled as well as the sexually frustrated. This selection of subjects provides a broad sampling of sexual life-styles found in contemporary America.</para>
<para>Each of the ten case studies included in this book is organized in the following fashion. First, the subject&#x2019;s life is reviewed chronologically, beginning with his or her earliest recollected experiences and progressing to the present time. Each subject has described his or her sexual experiences, thoughts, and feelings about those experiences. Every attempt has been made to preserve the subject&#x2019;s viewpoint, using the subject&#x2019;s own words and following the subject&#x2019;s own chronology except where necessary changes were made to ensure the subject&#x2019;s anonymity. All of the subjects reviewed their case histories and were allowed to make changes to preserve their anonymity. In this sense, the quotes are more refined than those usually found in casual conversation.</para>
<para>Following each subject&#x2019;s case, there is an analysis section in which I have identified significant issues from each case and integrated those issues with selections from the current literature. In this way we can see how each individual case study is linked to a much larger body of available sexuality literature. Following each brief analysis section is a short bibliography that will allow those of you who are interested to pursue any of the topics mentioned in the analysis section with more vigor and thoroughness.</para>
<para>Following the analysis sections are topical discussion questions that probe issues raised in each case studied. Many of these issues have direct bearing on the lives of college students. My students have found these discussion questions to be the most valuable part of this entire project. They enjoyed exploring the issues raised in this section and frequently found themselves in highly animated debate. I believe that anyone who seriously considers these discussion questions, particularly as they affect his or her own life, will gain a significant new understanding of human sexuality.</para>
<para><?docpage num="xvii"?>Now that these case studies are available in book form, it is my sincere hope that they will prove as interesting to you as they have to my students.</para>
<para><?docpage num="xviii"?><?docpage num="xix"?>A Beginning Note</para>
<para>When faced with sex we readily abandon respect for diversity and choice, we neglect any duty to understand human motivation and potentialities, and fall back on received pieties and authoritarian methods. The result can be devastating for those who are forced to live on the margins of social acceptability&#x2014;and inhibitive for those who do not.</para>

<para>While the term &#x201C;erotocentrism&#x201D; is now being used in contemporary discussions of sexuality, it is not yet listed in dictionaries. My students asked, so here is my definition:</para>
<para>Erotocentrism&#x2014;an overriding belief that one&#x2019;s sexual behavior and attitude is superior to all others and that one&#x2019;s own sexuality is the standard by which all others should be judged.</para>

<chapter xml:id="ch01" label="1">
<title><?docpage num="1"?>Beyond Dependency: Case Study of Libby Williams</title>
<para>Libby Williams, a wholesome, poised woman in her late forties, still retains the youthful charm and disarming smile that she had as a high school cheerleader. However, the last twenty-five years of her life have seasoned this once naive young woman and helped her emerge as the self-assured yet sensitive dean of a large state college.</para>
<para>Libby grew up in Tillamook, a small, rural town in northwestern Oregon where her father worked steadily as a heavy equipment operator while her mother stayed home. Libby spent most of her childhood raising her retarded younger brother, George. For many years she lovingly cared for him. With her father working long hours and frequently out &#x201C;with the boys,&#x201D; her mother kept to herself, sometimes not even speaking to the family for days at a time.</para>
<para>Until Libby was seven, her paternal grandmother lived with the family. Libby remembers many early experiences when her grandmother showered her with warmth and affection. Her grandmother first noticed Libby&#x2019;s intelligence. Even today, Libby believes she became an academic because of her grandmother&#x2019;s support for her school work. Her grandmother finally moved out because she could no longer stand the moody, silent periods and the strict and all-consuming moral self-righteousness of Libby&#x2019;s mother.</para>
<blockquote role="extract">
<para>My mother was an ultraconservative Baptist. She always feared the wrath of God. Her unending concern was to live a morally upright life. She saw evil lurking everywhere, in everything. She was a most unhappy person. As children, my brother and I were subject to the strictest code of conduct. I know this sounds hard to understand today, particularly in this environment [gestures at the campus outside her office window], but back then I was never allowed to see a movie or drink soda pop or wear jewelry, pants, or makeup. My father basically ignored my mother, which I think made her all the more strict with us. She was an extremely harsh disciplinarian with a bad temper. She even slapped George around if she felt he had sinned. I think, in some unconscious way, she felt George&#x2019;s retardation was her own punishment for sinning.</para>
</blockquote>
<para>Her grandmother&#x2019;s departure crushed Libby. The daily routine of taking care of her brother became more consuming. School was her only <?docpage num="2"?>chance to explore new worlds beyond her restrictive home life. She excelled academically, and eventually her teachers suggested that she transfer to a larger junior high school in a town nearby. Her mother rejected this suggestion. Libby recalled feeling no anger, just &#x201C;disappointed.&#x201D; Shortly after this happened, Libby&#x2019;s parents separated. Libby wanted to leave with her father and he was amenable to taking her; however, her mother insisted that if her father took her, he must also take George. Since her father was unwilling to take George, he left without Libby. Again, Libby reported not feeling angry, only &#x201C;disappointed.&#x201D;</para>
<para>During seventh and eighth grade, Libby continued to care for her brother while avoiding her mother&#x2019;s wrath whenever possible. She continued to do exceptionally well in school and, being attractive, was often asked out. Knowing her mother would never allow her to date, she always politely declined.</para>
<para>Libby&#x2019;s sexual education at home was nearly nonexistent. The only ideas communicated at home about sexuality were negative ones, based on her mother&#x2019;s conservative religious feelings. She learned about menstruation from her girlfriends, and she never witnessed any affection at home between her parents. The only explicit sexual message Libby received at home was when her mother caught her retarded brother, George, touching his genitals. She slapped him around the house repeatedly, telling him what an evil, sinful little boy he was.</para>
<para>As a child Libby never masturbated. She came to believe that sex was primarily of interest to men and that women participated to please them. In this way, women could use sex to obtain the affections of a man.</para>
<para>In high school, new and exciting things happened. Because Libby had to go to a larger town about thirty miles away for high school, she was able to develop a new social life quite hidden from her mother. She was popular at school. During her senior year, she was elected president of the senior class and became head cheerleader. She also dated the captain of the football team by whom she became pregnant.</para>
<blockquote role="extract">
<para>Tommy and I were like the kind of couple that is in every corny movie about high school. He was the big jock type&#x2014;very good looking. I was the eager, naive cheerleader type. Everyone in school thought we were the perfect couple. Even when I got pregnant, he was still the hero. He told me that we would have to get married right away.</para>
</blockquote>
<para>Predictably, Libby&#x2019;s mother became extremely upset. During the ensuing emotional conflict at home, Libby miscarried. However, Tommy kept his promise and married her shortly thereafter. Following graduation, the newlyweds moved to southern Oregon, where Tommy bought a sizable farm. Libby attended a local college where she eventually graduated <?docpage num="3"?>with honors. Tommy worked hard on the farm and spent a lot of time with his loving wife.</para>
<blockquote role="extract">
<para>Marrying Tommy and moving to southern Oregon was like a dream come true. Those first years together were beautiful&#x2014; wonderful. We were both so much in love. We shared everything. Our first son brought us even closer together. We were such proud parents. You would think we had invented something new.</para>
</blockquote>
<para>Although Tommy and Libby lived happily together those first years in Oregon and enjoyed being parents, in hindsight Libby reported that sexually their relationship was not dynamic. Libby had let Tommy have sex to secure his affection. She had also seen Tommy as a means of escape from her mother and the constant care that she had to provide for her brother. Their romantic life together did not include much sexual arousal or satisfaction for Libby; she never had an orgasm with Tommy. Tommy always instigated sex, and her only sexual excitement was giving him pleasure. In the same way that her early life had been consumed with providing support for George, now it was consumed with providing for Tommy, and later their children.</para>
<para>Two years after their first son was born, their relationship started to deteriorate rapidly. They had extended fights during which Tommy would stay in town for a day or two. Tommy made no effort to disguise his emerging involvements with other women. Libby felt helpless and disappointed.</para>
<blockquote role="extract">
<para>Tommy started being very depressed. He constantly said he felt trapped. The next four or five years we just rode an emotional roller coaster&#x2014;up one day and down in the pits the next. He usually was sensitive and caring, but he could be a real bastard sometimes. One night while his brother was staying with us, he asked me to strip so he and his brother could have a look. When I refused, he grabbed me and ripped off my clothes. Then he and his brother had me. [Libby begins crying. She sustained a broken arm during this incident.] He really wanted to degrade me. The saddest part of all was my own insecurity. I put up with this sort of thing without ever getting good and mad at him. I always assumed our problems were my fault.</para>
</blockquote>
<para>For the next year, Libby stayed with Tommy and gave birth to another son. Eventually, however, it became too much, and while Tommy was out of town, she left with the kids, writing a note apologizing for the problems she had caused him. Feeling lost, she moved to Eugene and began trying to survive, emotionally and financially. Within a year she <?docpage num="4"?>had secured a full academic scholarship for graduate work in psychology and began seeing a growth-oriented therapist.</para>
<blockquote role="extract">
<para>I underwent some dramatic changes then. I looked in the mirror and said, &#x201C;You are an untrained older woman with two kids&#x2014; can you make it alone?&#x201D; When I knew I could, I felt free and strong.</para>
</blockquote>
<para>During this period Libby dated several men. However, she did not become sexually involved with any of them because in some ways she &#x201C;still felt married.&#x201D; She had not legally or emotionally finished her relationship with Tommy.</para>
<para>Sexually speaking, this period in Libby&#x2019;s life proved to be rather difficult. Libby was interested in meeting new men and getting to know them. Because she was both bright and attractive, several men became quite interested in her as well. However, most of these men did want some sexual contact with her. So far in Libby&#x2019;s life, sex had been only an avenue of pleasing Tommy. At this point, she did not have sexual interests of her own, and she became depressed when most of these men would not continue seeing her without some sort of sexual contact. Since she did not want any sexual contact, her life became a series of short-lived dating situations that usually ended painfully.</para>
<para>Eventually, Tommy asked her to return to the farm. Libby agreed to bring the children down that weekend for a visit; she had high hopes for a major reconciliation, since Tommy had told her how much he missed both her and the children. Arriving one day early, she found him in bed with another woman. When she began to cry, he laughed, saying he had lied about missing her so that she would move back. He had lied in order to give himself a draft deferment (this was the early Vietnam War period).</para>
<blockquote role="extract">
<para>I became enraged for the first time in my life. I told him he was a bastard to manipulate me and the kids. I raged. He had never seen me angry before. It hit him hard.</para>
</blockquote>
<para>Tommy strode out of the house, roared off in his car, and drove into a telephone pole about a mile away, which killed him instantly.</para>
<blockquote role="extract">
<para>I have spent a lot of time thinking about Tommy&#x2019;s suicide. His life was coming unraveled pretty fast. The farm was a financial disaster. He was drinking a lot, he was concerned about the draft, and he probably knew that this was his last chance to get his family back and be in charge of us again. When I blew up at him, it was just the last straw. He had always controlled me, and he could not face losing that control as well as everything else.</para>
</blockquote>
<para><?docpage num="5"?>Libby returned to Eugene and school where she spent several years trying to put her life back together.</para>
<para>Tommy&#x2019;s suicide hit Libby hard. She had never been very assertive or comfortable expressing her anger. During key decision periods in her life, disappointment seemed to obscure any of her feelings of anger. After Tommy&#x2019;s suicide, she felt that her whole world was shattered; nevertheless, she suspected that her newly emerging feelings of anger signaled the beginning of a new life. Libby gradually realized that her dependency on Tommy had been destructive for her whole family and that ultimately she needed a different kind of relationship.</para>
<para>One of her professors, named Dale, helped her confront her anguish and anger. She and Dale became close friends and eventually lovers.</para>
<blockquote role="extract">
<para>Dale knew I was attracted to him. Lord knows I needed someone strong and caring to help me pull myself together. He was married, so we were only lovers a couple of times. We actually had more of a friendship than anything else. When I started feeling better about myself I found that we shared a lot academically. He also was great with the kids, which I figured helped them get over their loss too.</para>
</blockquote>
<para>Libby liked Dale for many reasons, but she was particularly impressed with his maturity and compassion:</para>
<blockquote role="extract">
<para>Dale&#x2019;s maturity impressed me. I thought, Here is someone whose own problems will not have to mess me up. He was supportive without being dominant. He was not a father figure, just a close friend who helped immeasurably. I knew I could never marry him, not only because of his wife, but also because he was so much older [sixteen years older]. I began to have a sense of the kind of person that would be good for me.</para>
</blockquote>
<para>Sexually, Libby&#x2019;s relationship with Dale was similar to her relationship with Tommy. She cared for Dale, but Dale was far more interested in sex than she was. She had sex with Dale in return for his compassion and help in dealing with Tommy&#x2019;s suicide. Dale helped Libby heal. She recalled that her overall feeling for Dale was similar to the one she used to have for her paternal grandmother, who had been the only adult to show her genuine affection when she was a child.</para>
<para>Shortly after Libby&#x2019;s thirty-second birthday, her relationship with Dale ended amicably. She moved back East to begin work on her Ph.D. with a full academic scholarship to a prestigious university.</para>
<para>During her six years in the Ph.D. program, Libby had several sexual relationships. The most significant relationship involved John, who was <?docpage num="6"?>also her academic adviser. She took John&#x2019;s graduate seminar her first semester. Often after class, several of the graduate students would go to a local bar for a few drinks. Frequently John would accompany them. A divorc&#x00E9;, John was known to get sexually involved with lots of women, many of them willing graduate students.</para>
<para>After one of these informal bar sessions, Libby found herself alone with John.</para>
<blockquote role="extract">
<para>The rest of the students left early while he and I were having an extended discussion about behaviorism. Fairly abruptly, both of us started sensing that we had more to discuss than just that. It was like all of a sudden we were looking into each other&#x2019;s eyes. John is an amazing person, but I did not want to become just another one of his women. I let him know I was interested in him without indicating that he should ask me out. We were in that bar a couple of hours, not flirting&#x2014;more like sparring. He came very close a couple of times to asking me out, but each time I gave him the feeling that I would probably say no. He is no dummy. He picked up all the clues and eventually we separated. The next night I asked him out.</para>
</blockquote>
<para>Libby and John became lovers the night of their first date. She described her visit to his apartment by saying,</para>
<blockquote role="extract">
<para>I sort of felt like I was walking into the lion&#x2019;s den. His apartment was like a typical bachelor pad. He had this black leather furniture all over and this low indirect lighting. It is sort of the decor one sees in <emphasis role="italic">Playboy.</emphasis> I wanted to be there. I had even left the kids at a friend&#x2019;s for the night, yet the whole feeling to his apartment nearly put me off. I was real nervous and he seemed so relaxed, yet I knew that I wanted to be involved with him.</para>
</blockquote>
<para>Libby&#x2019;s relationship with John lasted slightly over two years. They spent much time together, particularly in outdoor sports since both loved to ski and hike. John shared a lot with her, including several discussions about the many women he had known before. She reported that although he became eager to extend their relationship she felt less committed. Rather unexpectedly, John purchased a diamond engagement ring and asked her to marry him. When she declined, their relationship ended. Libby reported feeling &#x201C;flattered&#x201D; by John&#x2019;s proposal, but she did not want a long-term relationship with him. She was sorry to see him so deflated. John refused to speak to her after she rejected him.</para>
<para>Libby&#x2019;s relationship with John represented a turning point in her sexual development. Although she still had not had an orgasm, she did feel <?docpage num="7"?>herself becoming more responsive to him sexually than she had with any other man. She learned how to bring him to orgasm, and since that provided a great deal of pleasure for him, she felt she had more equality in their sexual relationship. Libby also felt that their relationship had been good for her bruised ego. John&#x2019;s reputation for attracting many intelligent, good-looking women and his offer of marriage gave Libby a heightened sense of herself as a desirable and interesting woman.</para>
<para>When she was thirty-eight she obtained her Ph.D. and returned to Oregon. Libby&#x2019;s new faculty position involved extensive research. On one research project, she met Dennis, a graduate research assistant assigned to her project.</para>
<para>Libby described Dennis as &#x201C;one of the best-looking men I have ever seen. His body ripples with muscles, which is quite a turn on.&#x201D; Dennis had been in the military and, like John, had a reputation for attracting many women. While he was serving in Vietnam, several of his close friends had been killed. In response to his Vietnam experience, he developed an insouciant, live-for-the-present life-style. Although he manifested a playful, nearly carefree attitude, Dennis also acquired a reputation for being one of the brightest and most promising of the research assistants.</para>
<para>While doing research together Dennis and Libby became &#x201C;buddies.&#x201D; The informal research atmosphere and his playfulness proved to be most conducive to a slowly emerging friendship. Initially, Libby was a sort of confidante to him, and she would often tease him about his involvements with other women. After they had worked together for over two years, Libby became romantically interested in him.</para>
<blockquote role="extract">
<para>I think I had always wanted to be more than just buddies, but part of my traditional background said that women should not instigate anything. He was worried that dating might ruin our working relationship. I think we were both surprised at how well it worked out. I made him know that he was number one in my book. I do not think he had ever had as much support and caring as I gave him. He taught me how to laugh again, how to play, how to skip and run naked in the mountains and how life can be ever so rich. He taught me to embrace everything. I remember one day in the woods, how he fell to his knees to smell the pine needles and earth. He was so full of life. His attitude was highly contagious.</para>
</blockquote>
<para>Libby and Dennis have now been lovers for over six years. Dennis is helping her enjoy and develop her sexuality.</para>
<blockquote role="extract">
<para>I had been [sexually] involved with several men. However, because of my traditional religious upbringing and the older men I <?docpage num="8"?>had been with, most of my sex life was a pretty straightforward, wham-bam-thank-you-ma&#x2019;am type thing. With him [Dennis] it is different. He is confident and assured, but more importantly, he accepts his body and mine. He taught me to love my body. Sex is an important and freeing part of our relationship. He is extremely sensitive, and we have excellent communication between us. He is a responsive lover, and we synchronize easily. I often have multiple orgasms with him, which is exciting for both of us. We just have a good, responsive, and playful sex life. Even the very first time we made love, Dennis noticed that I was not in tune with my own body. He encouraged me to explore my sexuality. It was a fabulous awakening!</para>
</blockquote>
<para>Libby feels she has now reached a new phase in her life. Professionally, she has distinguished herself as a professor, a department chair, and now as dean of the college. Her relationship with Dennis is qualitatively different, being both more fulfilling and satisfying than she had ever dreamed possible.</para>
<blockquote role="extract">
<para>Not long ago Dennis gave me a most sensual massage. First, he slowly undressed me, and then we showered together. Then he carefully heated some scented massage oil and proceeded to slowly stroke and lovingly caress my entire body. He spent almost two hours exploring and sensually rejuvenating my entire physical being. I tingled all over. In every part of my body he made me feel the kind of caring loving person he can be. When we made love afterward, I literally felt myself melting away as a separate person and being joyously consumed in our passionate bonding. These kinds of experiences provide a kind of renewing vitality, and they give me a healthy energy for the other dimensions of my life. Dennis is very special in my life.</para>
</blockquote>
<para>However, Libby is not sure what the future holds for herself and Dennis. Dennis&#x2019;s computer business is quite demanding, and her job as dean requires many long hours. Also, Libby feels that she has not finished growing and evolving into the kind of woman that she would like to be. She is not sure how she will grow and change or how those changes might affect her relationship with Dennis. She is fairly certain that she wants to make a long-term commitment with a person like Dennis, if not Dennis, but she is not certain that commitment is in the immediate future. She knows she will never again be the overly dependent and submissive woman she was with Tommy. She also believes that Dennis has significant issues remaining from Vietnam and his early childhood which he wants and <?docpage num="9"?>needs to address. She remains hopeful that they can both work out these issues while continuing to be supportive, caring, and passionately involved.</para>
<sect1 xml:id="ch01_sect1_1"><title><?docpage num="10"?>ANALYSIS</title>
<sect2 xml:id="ch01_sect2_2"><title>Emotional Dependency</title>
<para>Since she was raised in a restrictive and intellectually limited family environment, bullied first by her mother and then by Tommy, it seemed improbable that Libby Williams would ultimately develop a dynamic professional career and sexual identity. But she did. In understanding how Libby overcame her emotional dependency, the work of Peele and Brodsky should prove insightful.</para>
<para>In their <emphasis role="italic">Love and Addiction</emphasis> (1975), they discuss how individuals who are very pliable, overly trusting, unsure of themselves, and lacking in selfconfidence are often susceptible to addictive (or what we now term <emphasis role="italic">dependent)</emphasis> behavior. They go on to say that &#x201C;love is an ideal vehicle for dependency because it can so exclusively claim a person&#x2019;s consciousness&#x201D; (Peele 1980, 70). Libby&#x2019;s relationship with Tommy is a classic case of codependency. Libby tolerated a broken arm and gang rape from Tommy while still feeling that she caused most of the problems in their relationship. She even left him a note apologizing when she eventually moved out. When she finally asserted her independence and became angry, his dependency fueled his suicide.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 xml:id="ch01_sect2_3"><title>Quality of Relationships</title>
<para>One major issue we will be reviewing in all of these case studies is the quality established in sexual relationships. Although Tommy and Libby&#x2019;s marriage seemed fairly idyllic at first, their codependency proved problematic. Peele provides some interesting criteria for analyzing relationships and distinguishing between those that embrace a positive enactment of love and those that become dependent:</para>
<itemizedlist mark="none">
<listitem><para>1. Does each lover have a secure belief in his or her own value?</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>2. Are the lovers improved by their relationship?</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>3. Do the lovers maintain serious interests outside the relationship, including other meaningful personal relationships?</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>4. Is the relationship integrated into the totality of the lovers&#x2019; lives?</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>5. Are the lovers beyond being possessive or jealous of each other&#x2019;s growth?</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>6. Are the lovers friends? (Peele and Brodsky 1980, 83-84)</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
<para>Though dependency is not a black-and-white issue, using these criteria shows that Libby and Tommy&#x2019;s relationship can hardly be viewed <?docpage num="11"?>as healthy. For students who are interested, the authors&#x2019; last chapter, &#x201C;From Addiction [Dependency] to Love,&#x201D; contains several insightful suggestions on how to build a supportive rather than a dependent relationship.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 xml:id="ch2_sect2_4">
<title>Sexual Awareness</title>
<para>Libby Williams&#x2019;s ability to experience and understand her own sexuality emerged slowly. Throughout her relationships with Tommy and Dale, Libby was not very aware of her own sexual feelings or interests. Although orgasms are certainly not the ultimate yardstick for evaluating sexual fulfillment, Libby spent much of her adult life not even knowing whether she could have one (which of course almost everyone can).</para>
<para>In her sensitive and insightful classic <emphasis role="italic">For Yourself: The Fulfillment of Female Sexuality</emphasis> (1976), Lonnie Barbach details a step-by-step process by which women can discover the pleasurable sensations inherent in female arousal. For Barbach and many others (for example, Dodson 1987), one key for many women to sexual awareness is masturbation: &#x201C;Masturbation is one of the best ways to learn about your sexual responses&#x201D; (Barbach 1976, 88). Barbach proceeds to discuss the historical and social restrictions placed primarily on women which have discouraged them from exploring their sexuality. She concludes that society&#x2019;s aversion to masturbation is ill-founded.</para>
<blockquote role="extract">
<para>The guilt, fear, anxiety and repulsion that surrounds masturbation is astounding, especially when one realizes not only how pervasive it is among human beings but how beneficial, pleasurable and relaxing. (88&#x2014; 89)</para>
</blockquote>
<para>While presenting a thoughtful and sequential program for helping women achieve sexual fulfillment, Barbach also discusses how important sexual fulfillment can be in one&#x2019;s life:</para>
<blockquote role="extract">
<para>Sexual liberation is one aspect of personal liberation. Taking control of your life, at the most intimate, personal, and fundamental level&#x2014;the level of your sexuality&#x2014;seems to lead to extending control over other areas of your life. . . . Once we feel better about ourselves, once we assume that we have rights that deserve respect from others, we are in a position to begin liberating ourselves. . . . Liberation means having the freedom to be strong and caring of others, while still being able to be open and accepting of care from others. Liberation entails being free to be passive and receiving or to be assertive and giving. . . . When you can take control of your life and feel free to be yourself, when you are personally liberated, you lose fear. . . . Sexual liberation is a beginning. (197-98)</para>
</blockquote>
</sect2>
<sect2 xml:id="ch1_sect2_5">
<title><?docpage num="12"?>Moving Beyond Dependency</title>
<para>Probably without knowing the means or outcome, Libby began her personal journey toward sexual and personal satisfaction after Tommy&#x2019;s suicide. With both Dale and John, Libby formed less dependent relationships and began to develop her own sexual identity. Finally, her relationship with Dennis gave her the opportunity to be more her own person, to have orgasms, and to share a mutually satisfying sex life. Her relationship with Dennis awakened her sensual potential and taught her how to be intimate by being aware of her own needs and feelings. Libby is no longer the dependent female who can relate to males only by caring for them. In this, she has overcome her restrictive upbringing to discover new dimensions of herself and her sexuality.</para>
<para>While it is obvious that no single sexual life-style is necessarily the best, Libby&#x2019;s explorations and personal growth have provided a more productive and satisfying life <emphasis role="italic">for her.</emphasis> Libby is a dynamic woman who had the intelligence, perseverance, and opportunities to create this new sexual life-style for herself. In this, she is most fortunate.</para>
<para>In our next case study, that of Stan Fitzgerald, we will see that developing a satisfying sexual life-style can be quite problematic.</para>
