<p class="noindent">In the grand diversity of life, birds have long held a special place in the interest and imagination of humans. Part of that interest is because birds provide important resources&#8212;being directly consumed as food or providing materials such as feathers for bedding and winter clothing, or bones for making tools. Additionally, birds may be useful guides to other resources. The Greater Honeyguide (<i>Indicator indicator</i>), for example, has been used by generations of people in sub-Saharan Africa to find bee colonies. Birds can also be useful indicators of environmental quality. Historically, coal miners brought caged canaries into mines to alert them of dangerous air conditions&#8212;the proverbial &#8220;canary in a coal mine&#8221;&#8212;and, in the more recent past, birds like the Peregrine Falcon (<i>Falco peregrinus</i>; <a href="ch1.xhtml#ch1fig1">fig. 1.1</a>) alerted us to the harmful effects of the once commonly used insecticide DDT.</p>
<p class="indent">While we clearly derive many benefits from birds, our interest in them transcends the practical and is heightened by their conspicuous and ubiquitous presence in the world around us. Birds have been widely depicted in our culture for thousands of years in a variety of forms, including song, dance, poetry, paintings, and fashion. Our artistic, cultural, and recreational connections to birds remain strong today. The millions of people engaging in bird-watching each year provide evidence of this connection.</p>
<p class="indent">Given the visibility and prominence of birds, almost everyone is familiar with them and can distinguish them from other groups of animals. Even so, many people would be hard-pressed to explain the defining attributes of birds. What makes a bird a bird?</p>
<section epub:type="title">
<h3 epub:type="title" class="h3" id="ch001">CLASSIFICATION OF BIRDS</h3>
<p class="noindent">All life on Earth can be classified, or organized, into a series of hierarchical groups based on shared characteristics. This classification is called &#8220;taxonomy,&#8221; and its father was Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish biologist who developed the Linnaean classification system for naming organisms with two names that reflect those groupings (e.g., humans are <i>Homo sapiens</i>). More recently, Carl Woese and colleagues have used molecular tools to add additional resolution to taxonomic classification. Their work resulted in the addition of the classification of domain to divide cellular life into three groups, largely reflecting differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Domains called Eubacteria and Archaebacteria (sometimes called Bacteria and Archaea, respectively) contain unicellular organisms with prokaryotic cells that lack nuclei. In contrast, the domain Eukaryota contains eukaryotic organisms with cells that are nucleated. Only protists (kingdom Protista), which includes the famed <i>Paramecium</i> and amoebas, have both unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes.</p>
<figure class="imagef" id="ch1fig1"><img src="../images/Figure_1.1.jpg" alt="Images"/>
<figcaption class="figcap"><i>Figure 1.1.</i> The Peregrine Falcon (<i>Falco peregrinus</i>) was one of several species whose populations plummeted because of eggshell thinning associated with the pesticide DDT.

<p class="indent"><span id="page-4" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 4. "/>
Among members of the domain Eukayota, the highest level of classification is the kingdom, of which there are five or six, depending on how one classifies bacteria (<a href="ch1.xhtml#ch1fig2">fig. 1.2</a>). The remaining kingdoms are composed of multicellular eukaryotic organisms. Species in kingdom Plantae can make their own food (i.e., they are autotrophic), whereas those in kingdoms Fungi and Animalia must consume other organisms to survive (i.e., they are heterotrophic). Like the other members of kingdom Animalia, birds are multicellular and heterotrophic organisms that have eukaryotic cells.</p>
<p class="indent">Within kingdom Animalia, birds belong to phylum Chordata, which means that at some point in their development they have a notochord, a dorsal and hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail. Birds also belong to the subphylum Vertebrata because they have vertebrae surrounding the nerve cord, a brain enclosed by a skull, an endoskeleton, a well-developed coelom that contains the viscera, a closed circulatory system with a ventral heart, a complete digestive system, and excretion via kidneys. At the class level of organization, animals are classified into several familiar groups&#8212;birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, jawless fish, cartilaginous fish, bony fish, and so on (<a href="ch1.xhtml#ch1fig3">fig. 1.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">At the time of writing, there are 82 families and 28 orders within class Aves, and those groups comprise roughly 9,800 species of birds, each with a unique classification (<a href="ch1.xhtml#ch1fig4">fig. 1.4</a>). You might wonder why we specify &#8220;at the time of writing&#8221; or mention &#8220;<i>roughly</i> 9,800 species.&#8221; The reason is that taxonomy is a living field, and classifications change as we learn more about birds, improve our molecular techniques, and even discover new species. Species concepts can also impact how scientists assess how many species of birds there are. For example, proponents of the biological species concept tend to recognize 9,800 species, whereas advocates of the phylogenetic species concept would recognize many more species (perhaps even twice as many). You will read more about these concepts and their role in species recognition later in the book.</p>

<h3 epub:type="title" class="h3" id="ch02">TRAITS SHARED WITH OTHER ANIMAL GROUPS</h3>
<p class="noindentb"><span id="page-5" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 5. "/>
Have you ever heard someone refer to birds as living dinosaurs? Usually what the person means is that birds descended from reptilian ancestors during the Mesozoic (65 to 250 million years ago) and, later, from dinosaurs. That evolutionary history is why modern birds share a number of traits with reptiles, including:</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Single occipital condyle.</i> The occipital condyle is where the skull connects to the vertebral column. Both birds and reptiles have only one, whereas mammals and amphibians have two.</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Single middle ear bone.</i> Unlike mammals, which have three bones in the middle ear, birds and reptiles have only one bone in the middle ear.</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Fused jawbones.</i> The jaws of birds and reptiles comprise five fused bones. Mammals, in contrast, have a single jawbone.</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Nucleated red blood cells.</i> In humans and other groups, red blood cells lack nuclei. In contrast, red blood cells in birds and reptiles contain a nucleus.</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Egg structure.</i> Reptiles and birds, along with monotremes (i.e., three species of echidnas and the duckbill platypus [<i>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</i>]), lay eggs out of water and thus share a similar egg structure that requires a protective shell. They also share the same membranes: the amnion, which protects the embryo in a fluid-filled sac; the yolk sac, which contains food for the embryo; the chorion, which lines the inner surface of the shell and helps with gas exchange; and the allantois, which stores metabolic waste.</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Egg tooth.</i> Hatchling birds and reptiles have an egg tooth, or small hook on the beak, that helps the young break through the eggshell when hatching.</p>
<p class="hangb"><i>Uncinate processes of the ribs.</i> Most species of birds and reptiles have extensions of bone from each rib that help strengthen the rib cage (<a href="ch1.xhtml#ch1fig5">fig. 1.5</a>). These uncinate processes can also improve the effectiveness of muscles involved in respiration.</p>
<p class="indentb">Even though birds are more closely related to reptiles, they share the following two key traits with mammals:</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Endothermic.</i> Birds and mammals can regulate and maintain warm body temperatures. Although some species of sharks and other fishes (e.g., tuna) are endotherms, birds and mammals represent the only classes of animals that are universally endothermic.</p>
<figure class="imagef" id="ch1fig5"><img src="../images/Figure_1.5.jpg" alt="Images"/>
<figcaption class="figcap"><i>Figure 1.5.</i> The furcula is highlighted in red. Uncinate processes are evident along the posterior margin of each rib and are a trait shared by modern birds and reptiles. <i>Wikimedia Commons</i>.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="hang"><span id="page-6" role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 6. "/>
<i>Four-chambered heart.</i> The hearts of birds and mammals have four chambers&#8212;two atria and two ventricles&#8212;that separate oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, allowing for a very efficient &#8220;double circulatory system.&#8221; Despite the similar anatomical design, the hearts of birds are proportionately larger than those of mammals, which helps birds meet the high metabolic demands of flight.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="title">
<h3 epub:type="title" class="h3" id="ch03">WHAT MAKES BIRDS UNIQUE?</h3>
<p class="noindent">All birds share certain characteristics that distinguish them from other groups of animals. Surprisingly, some of the traits that we most closely associate with birds&#8212;wings and laying eggs&#8212;are not unique to them. After all, flying mammals (bats) and insects also have wings, and eggs are laid by a wide variety of animals, including insects, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and monotremes. So how are birds distinct?</p>
<p class="indentb">If we consider the traits that are unique to birds, most are adaptations for flight. Birds have many adaptations for flight that reduce weight while increasing strength and power.</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Pneumatic bones.</i> Certain flightless birds, including penguins and ostriches, have solid bones. Birds that fly, however, have some bones that are pneumatic, which are lighter than solid bones because they lack marrow and have, instead, air-filled canals strengthened by internal struts.</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Fused and reduced bones.</i> Birds have many fused and reduced bones, which decrease weight while providing the strength and stability required for flight. For example, the thoracic, pelvic, and tail regions of the spine are fused to maintain body posture during flight. Likewise, the bones of the hand are fused and reduced to support the flight feathers. An important skeletal modification is the fusion of the clavicles into a single bone called the furcula, or wishbone (<a href="ch1.xhtml#ch1fig5">fig. 1.5</a>). The furcula prevents the chest from collapsing on the downward stroke of the wings.</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Keel.</i> Birds have two powerful flight muscles that are responsible for the flapping of the wing&#8212;the pectoralis and supracoracoideus muscles. These muscles are so well-developed in birds that they require a greater area of attachment than is typically found on the breastbone, or sternum, of an animal that does not fly. The keel is a blade-shaped projection of the sternum where the large flight muscles attach.</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Toothless and horny beak.</i> Teeth may not seem to weigh much, but every little bit counts for a flying bird. Early birds had teeth, but modern birds have toothless jaws covered with a horny sheath that are much lighter than jawbones with teeth. Beaks show an impressive range of shapes and sizes, each adapted to the ecology of the bird, typically related to what it eats (<a href="ch1.xhtml#ch1fig6">fig. 1.6</a>).</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Reduced urogenital system.</i> The urogenital system of birds is highly modified to reduce weight. Birds lack a urinary bladder and urethra and, hence, can avoid carrying water. Avian kidneys contribute to water conservation by producing uric acid that is excreted as a semisolid paste. Most species also lack a phallus and instead rely on a single opening, called a cloaca, for reproductive and excretory functions. Gonads are either absent, as with most females, which have only a single ovary, or recess greatly during nonbreeding seasons.</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Respiratory efficiency&#8212;air sacs.</i> To meet the oxygen demands for flight and to fuel their high metabolism, the respiratory system of birds is much more efficient than that of other animals. Unlike mammals, birds do not have a diaphragm to help move air through the respiratory system. Instead, birds have air sacs that increase the amount of air that can be inhaled and also function like bellows, moving air so that gas exchange occurs continuously.</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Feathers.</i> Although you might think of feathers as adaptations for flight, they actually serve a wide variety of purposes, including insulation, courtship display, camouflage, and communication (<a href="ch1.xhtml#ch1fig7">fig. 1.7</a>). Among living animals, feathers are unique to birds, though the fossil record shows some of the dinosaurs from which birds evolved also had feather-like structures. Scientists long thought that feathers were simply modified scales, but more recent research has suggested that feathers are actually novel epidermal structures (i.e., not developed directly from reptilian-type scales).</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Hallux.</i> Birds have a unique foot structure with a modified big toe called the &#8220;hallux.&#8221; In most birds, the hallux is oriented backward, but foot structure in birds is highly variable and related to the behavior and ecology of a species.</p>
<p class="hang"><i>Syrinx.</i> The vocal organ of birds is called the syrinx, which is located at the base of the bird&#8217;s trachea. Unlike a mammal&#8217;s larynx, the syrinx lacks vocal cords and instead acts as a resonating chamber of elastic and vibrating membranes. In further contrast to the mammalian vocal system, which contains only one set of vocal cords, the avian syrinx contains multiple sets of vibrating structures, enabling birds to produce two different sounds at the same time. Birds can vary those sounds by changing air pressure and the tension of the syringeal muscles, and those vocal performances have long fascinated professional and amateur naturalists.</p>
<p class="hangb"><i>Highly developed vision.</i> Vision is more developed in birds than in most other animals. Birds not only can see objects at great distance, but they also see color. Interestingly, the eyes are among the few organs that are proportionately larger in birds than in most other animals. The size and placement of the eyes can tell a lot about the ecology of a species. Predatory birds that pursue prey usually have eyes toward the front of the head, whereas many prey species have eyes on the sides or top of the head to better detect predators.</p>

<h3 epub:type="title" class="h3" id="ch04">ORNITHOLOGY: THE STUDY OF BIRDS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Ornithology, the topic of this textbook, is a branch of science that focuses on the study of birds. The word &#8220;ornithology&#8221; comes from the ancient Greek words &#8004;&#961;&#957;&#953;&#962; <i>ornis</i> (bird) and &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; <i>logos</i> (explanation). Ornithology has old roots, and some of the earliest scientific accounts of birds date back to 1500 BC, where the Vedas, a Sanskrit text from ancient India, included careful observations about distribution, life history, and ecology of birds. Despite birds being a subject of study for thousands of years, ornithology did not emerge as a professional discipline until the eighteenth century.</p>
<p class="indent">Since then, ornithology has played an important role in the development of ideas that are foundational to the biological and ecological sciences today. The ideas of Charles Darwin and his articulation of the theory of natural selection were strongly shaped by his study of Galapagos finches. Our understanding of density-dependence in population regulation was influenced by David Lack&#8217;s studies of birds, and theories about competition and competitive exclusion were influenced by Robert MacArthur&#8217;s study of boreal forest warblers. Research by Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson provided the foundation for island biogeography theory and, subsequently, the field of landscape ecology. Even the establishment of the field of ethology (or behavior) was heavily influenced by pioneering work on imprinting behavior and instinct in birds by Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen, respectively.</p>

Although a focus on birds might be viewed by some as narrow, ornithology includes a broad range of topics, and most scientists specialize in only one or a few of them. Areas of specialization include molecular genetics, taxonomy, physiology, communication, behavior, evolution, population demography, disease ecology, and many more. Traditionally aligned with natural sciences, modern ornithology now includes the social sciences and topics such as the economic impacts of bird-feeding, social psychology of bird-watching, cultural relevance of birds, and birds as learning tools in educational programs. For some, the decision to study birds may reflect personal curiosity and fascination with birds. For others, the focus might be more practical, because birds provide a tractable system for addressing questions and problems that cut across many systems. Indeed, birds can offer an effective lens through which we can view and understand the world around us.</p>
<p class="indent">Throughout this textbook, in the boxes included in each chapter, you will discover the diverse interests and professional affiliations of ornithologists. <a href="ch30.xhtml#ch30">Chapter 30</a> provides a more in-depth view of the various career paths that are available in ornithology and the ways you might best position yourself to encounter professional opportunities. Even if you are not interested in becoming an ornithologist, you can still contribute in meaningful ways to the discipline. One thing that distinguishes ornithology from many other sciences is the important role played by amateurs and citizen scientists, who have made remarkable contributions to advancing and refining our knowledge of birds and their habitats. You also will find descriptions of the ways that amateurs can contribute in <a href="ch30.xhtml#ch30">chapter 30</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">We hope that as you read this textbook and reflect on the questions presented in each chapter, you will develop a better appreciation of how diverse ornithology is in terms of topics and contributors, as well as the ways that the field has contributed to our understanding of basic and applied sciences.</p>
